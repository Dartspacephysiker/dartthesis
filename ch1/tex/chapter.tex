\section{A word before things pick up}

If the pursuit of knowledge fills the soul with joy, then
communication of it brings the soul to overflowing. Science that is
worth its mettle and of respectable vintage---the ``hard stuff,'' so
to speak---will be steeped in a laconic grammar befitting pursuit of
that brand of truth first minted by Bacon, and much later, by Popper's
inveterate philosophical craft, turned to diamond: careful, measured,
and repeatable observation, followed by deduction and falsifiable
conclusion, corrected for faulty intuition and attended to with utter
impartiality---or at least a show of it that is on par for winning
proposals, scoring grant money and keeping up the guise (and make sure
to say something about the Roadmap!).

Having drunk reverently, deeply, and frequently from this cup, this
veritable goblet of gladness, I opt to lay the rudiments of the
present work at its outset in the parlance of the commoner---the
salesman, the nurse, the brickmason, the entrepreneur$^*$---that all
who desire may sup the elixir, if only for a chapter.

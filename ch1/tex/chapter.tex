\section{A word before things pick up}

If science fills the soul with joy, then scientific communication
brings the soul to overflowing. If worth its mettle and of respectable
vintage---the ``hard stuff,'' so to speak---it will be steeped in a
laconic grammar befitting pursuit of the brand of truth minted at
first by Bacon, and much later by Popper's inveterate philosophical
craft, turned to diamond: careful, measured, and repeatable
observation, followed by deduction and falsifiable conclusion,
corrected for faulty intuition and attended to with utter impartiality
(or at least a show of it that is on par for scoring grant money and
keeping up a guise---but make sure to say something about the
Roadmap!).

Having drunk reverently, deeply, and frequently from this cup, this
veritable goblet of gladness, I opt to lay the rudiments of the
present work at its outset in the parlance of the laity---the
salesman, the nurse, the brickmason, the entrepreneur$^*$---that all
who desire may sup the elixir, if only for a chapter.

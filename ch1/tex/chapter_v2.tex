\section{A word before things pick up}

If the pursuit of knowledge fills the soul with joy, then the
communication of it brings the soul to overflowing.\footnote{We pass
  in piety over the many and ongoing instances in which otherwise
  respectable science has evolved into bloodsport.} Science worth its
mettle and of certifiable vintage will be steeped in a laconic grammar
befitting pursuit of that brand of truth first minted by Bacon, and
much later, by Popper's inveterate philosophy, turned to diamond:
careful, measured, and repeatable observation, followed by deduction
and falsifiable prediction, corrected for faulty intuition and
attended to with utter impartiality---or at least a display of it
sufficing to avoid being given the lie.

Having drunk reverently, deeply, and frequently from this cup, this
veritable goblet of gladness, I opt to lay the rudiments of the
present work at its outset in the parlance of the laity---the
salesman, the nurse, the blockmason, the entrepreneur, the
custodian\footnote{All honorable occupations held by the author's
  family members, some of which he has also held.}---that all who
desire may sup the elixir, if only for a chapter. But if I do not
disallow that the imbibing of these spirits may spur, in its course,
to greater heights, I am contrariwise attended by an assurance of the
impenetrability of succeeding chapters to the mind unequipped with the
several keys of knowledge which I forthwith commence to afford.

Let's start with some background and history. I guess you're familiar with sound
waves? The idea that the air can vibrate and carry the sound of music, the sound
of a fog horn, the drop of a pin, yadda yadda?

Right. Just think about the speed of sound, which I bet you've come across
before. We'll call it $v_s$. Here's the thing: in simple cases\footnote{I'm
  glossing over a lot of the legwork because we've got a long way to go in a
  different direction. Check out your favorite intro text if you want to dig
  into details.}  $v_s$ dictates a relationship between the wavelength $\lambda$
and frequency $f$ of a particular sound wave. Namely,
\begin{equation}
  \label{ch1:eqvs}
  \lambda f = v_s,
\end{equation}
or, just as good,
\begin{equation}
  \label{ch1:eqvsdiff}
  \lambda = \dfrac{v_s}{f}.
\end{equation}
What do (\ref{ch1:eqvs}) and (\ref{ch1:eqvsdiff}) mean? That $\lambda$ and $f$
are \emph{proportional} to each other---inversely proportional, that is---and
the so-called \emph{constant of proportionality} is $v_s$, the speed of
sound!

% \footnote{In practice,
  % scientists prefer the form \ref{ch1:eqvs} because $\lambda$ is a length and
  % $f$ indicates ``how many per time;'' if you multiply $\lambda$ and $f$
  % together, you get a ``distance per time,'' or a speed!}

For example, when you pluck the low E string on a guitar (which is the fattest
string)\footnote{We're assuming standard EADGBE tuning. The time fails to
  quibble with different tunings.} it vibrates; in turn, the vibrating E string
causes the air pressure to pulsate\footnote{In the lingo, a sound wave is what
  is known as a \emph{compressional mode}. As we'll see later on, some fluids
  also support \emph{transverse modes}.} at a frequency of about 82~Hz, and
those pulsations travel to your ear and everywhere else. When you hear it, it is
knocking at your eardrum 82 times each second: $f = $~82~Hz.  Well, suppose
$v_s =$~340~m/s---a pretty good answer by cereal box standards---the wavelength
$\lambda$ of the sound wave carrying that low E is 4~m, which is about the
length of my 1993 Buick Century Special. How about we ascend in pitch to the
next string on guitar, the A string?  $f = $~110~Hz, and according to
equation~(\ref{ch1:eqvs}), $\lambda \simeq$~3.1~m--about the distance from the
ground to the net of a basketball hoop.

You get the picture: if you start ascending the E major scale on your guitar so
that the pitch of each note steadily increases, nature has informed us that the
wavelength of the sound wave carrying each note you play gets shorter and
shorter so that equation~(\ref{ch1:eqvs}) is always true---which is to say that
sound waves always propagate at the speed of sound.\footnote{Except when they
  don't, but we'll not rove in this direction because we have other destinations
  in mind.}

Why are we talking about this? Because there's an important concept illustrated
here, what some of us laboratory-bound types call a \emph{dispersion relation}
that I promise you will make cameo appearances, albeit in different costume,
throughout this thesis. We'll come back to dispersion relations shortly. A more
pressing issue that deserves your attention is that in their present forms the
relations (\ref{ch1:eqvs}) and (\ref{ch1:eqvsdiff}), while not wrong, would
nevertheless make some physicists (shy and delicate creatures as they are)
uncomfortable. The short explanation is that $f$ measures inverse time while
$\lambda$ has units of length, which, you may be surprised to learn, would
represent a gross imbalance to the mind of many a physicist.\footnote{The
  imbalance is not simply aesthetic, either. There are very good reasons to put
  time and space on equal footing, far from the least of which is the paving of
  a conceptual pathway between physical domains of time and space and their
  spectral counterparts. This pathway turns out to be important for any area of
  physics that deals heavily in waves, including quantum mechanics.}

\subsection{The wave number $\mathbf{k}$, and a philosophical excursion}
\label{subsec:k}

To put time and space on equal footing (admittedly only in terms of
units\footnote{Even if our present aim to achieve equal footing for
  Equation~(\ref{ch1:eqvs}) is base (we're just changing units, after all), the
  spirit of our aim is lofty. To truly put time and space on equal footing, on
  simultaneously quantum and relativistic scales, is among the highest and most
  sweeping challenges facing the last century or so of physics.}) let me
introduce you the concept of \emph{spatial frequency}, the typical,\footnote{We
  are not talking about the \emph{spectroscopic wave number}
  $\nu \equiv 1 / \lambda$ that I understand is common among chemists.}
mathematical definition\footnote{Definitions, the troublesome things. I have
  observed that beginning students in physics are prone to confuse definitions,
  such as the definitions of wave number (\ref{ch1:eqk}) and work (i.e., the
  energy resulting from a force acting over a distance), with physical laws. A
  definition is no such thing. Instead, a definition is some quantity that keeps
  presenting or suggesting itself in the process of research that makes sense to
  set aside and give formally bestowed meaning---a \emph{definition}. The root
  of confusion seems to be that each discipline is heavily steeped in naturally
  arising, field-specific lingo; intertwinement of lingo with the laws that get
  described in terms of that lingo produces a trap for unwary laity and budding
  physicists alike.} of which is
\begin{equation}
  \label{ch1:eqk}
  k = \dfrac{2 \pi}{\lambda}.
\end{equation}
``Great,'' I can hear you saying to yourself. ``You managed to obfuscate the
meaning of wavelength by burying it in the denominator and decorating it with
superfluous numbers.'' Well, give me a minute to explain.

One way to understand the reason for placing $2 \pi$ in the numerator is that we
want to compare any frequencies we observe against a comprehensive
standard.\footnote{I'm altogether avoiding the subject of phase of a cycle; you
  can find it in any introductory textbook that is worth even an iota of its
  salt.} ``What standard?'' Great question! Think: a pattern that repeats itself
at a regular interval (whether spatial or temporal) is a cycle, and the simplest
and most universal example of a cycle is a \emph{circle}---particularly a circle
defined to have a radius of 1 (i.e., the unit circle), which has a circumference
of $2 \pi$.  Adopting the unit circle as our ``standard cycle'' against which to
measure every other cycle, we compare both temporal and spatial frequencies
against $2 \pi$, which is the numerical representation of our adopted
standard.\footnote{At least to me, by comparing various types of cycles against
  the most basic form of a cycle (which I have unilaterally asserted is the unit
  circle) we are toeing the line at which we implicitly accept the existence of
  an archetype---a concept that I understand was first presented by Plato.}

Now that we see the light, may we likewise outfit temporal frequency with a
factor of $2 \pi$? Let's define
\begin{equation}
  \label{ch1:eqomega}
  \omega = 2 \pi f.
\end{equation}
It feels nice, doesn't it? With the definitions (\ref{ch1:eqk}) and
(\ref{ch1:eqomega}) for $k$ and $\omega$, both spatial and temporal cycles (or
frequencies) are being compared against the archetypal cycle---the ``gold
standard''---which is the unit circle, in the form of the number 2$\pi$.

I hope you find the foregoing explanation as aesthetically pleasing as I do. But
I am aware that aesthetic satisfaction doesn't correspond to comprehension, so
let me illustrate the concept of spatial frequency at work. For my first
example, you don't even have to take your eyes off this or the succeeding lines
of text: the distance between the top of one letter on this line to the top of a
letter on the next line is 40 pts,\footnote{A pt (or ``point''), which is a
  typographical unit, is such that 72~pts~$=$~1~inches.}  or roughly 0.5~inches
(get a ruler if you want to check yourself). We could say
$\lambda \simeq$~0.5~inches, or
$k = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \simeq 4 \pi$~rad/inch. We could probably do some
simple tests to find that books that humans can read with the naked eye must
have $k_{\textrm{max}} \lesssim$~16$\pi$~rad/in. It's nothing more than a mathy
way of saying, ``If the text is too small, no one will be able to read
it''---something you already knew, cast in terms of spatial frequency.

I'll give you one more example, which is shown in
Figure~\ref{ch1:FigDesert}. There were clearly waves in the sand when the
picture was taken, and they clearly weren't going anywhere anytime soon; by all
appearances the temporal frequency of these waves was $f =$~0~Hz.  How about
spatial frequency? My estimate is that the average distance between wave crests,
or the average wavelength $\lambda =$~10~cm (about 4~inches), which is
equivalent to $k =$~$\frac{\pi}{5}$~rad/cm.  If you pay attention to clouds in
the sky, it won't be long before you're rewarded with a sighting of spatially
periodic structures in the clouds.

  \caption[Desert waves]{Waves in desert sand that, unlike ocean waves (for
    example), are \emph{fixed} in time and therefore have a temporal frequency of
    zero! Their spatial frequency is not zero, however.}
  \label{ch1:FigDesert}
\end{figure}

% ----------------

% OK, we now see that spatial frequency is ``out in the real world.'' Still,
% couldn't we stick with $\lambda$ instead? Figure~\ref{ch1:FigDesert} beautifully
% illustrates the reason why there's no special reason to stick with $\lambda$. A
% question for you: Can you tell me where the peak of the wave is in
% Figure~\ref{ch1:FigDesert}? I hope you are bothered by my question, and that you
% are saying to yourself, ``Spencer is off his rocker. Those are ridgelines, not
% peaks, and there are probably fifty separate ridgelines in that shot!''
% Exactly. Compared to talking about wavelength, it makes at least as much sense
% to talk about the repeating pattern of waves in the sand in terms of spatial
% frequency.

I keep threatening to put time and space are on equal footing. If I rearrange
(\ref{ch1:eqk}) and (\ref{ch1:eqomega}) so that $\lambda = \frac{2 \pi}{k}$ and
$f = \frac{\omega}{2 \pi}$, and insert these expressions for $\lambda$ and $f$
into (\ref{ch1:eqvs}), I get
\begin{equation}
  \label{ch1:eqvomegak}
  \lambda f = \Big ( \dfrac{\cancel{2 \pi}}{k} \Big ) \Big ( \dfrac{\omega}{\cancel{2 \pi}} \Big ) = \dfrac{\omega}{k} = v_s.
\end{equation}
The two rightmost expressions, $\omega / k = v_s$, are indeed
satisfying. Equation \ref{ch1:eqvomegak} would make any physicist who deals with
continuous matter\footnote{This includes physicists working in hydrodynamics,
  tectonics, solid state and condensed matter, plasma, and statistical
  mechanics, to name a few.} feel more or less at home.

\subsection{What determines the speed at which waves propagate in a fluid?}
\label{subsec:wavspeed}

Besides talking about the existence of the speed of sound and fiddling with
definitions, there's another question we might ask: How did the air decide to
pick $v_s$ as the ``right speed'' for sound waves to travel? Why not the speed
of light, $c$? Why not my Buick's top speed, 80~mph ($\sim$129~kph)? If I hadn't
skipped the details that lead to equation (\ref{ch1:eqvs}), we would have seen
that nature picks $v_s$ based on the air temperature $T$ and the mass of
consituent molecules\footnote{We'll keep things simple and say the
  \emph{average} mass of a molecule in the air you're breathing. Poke around in
  the right books and you'll find that the average mass of an air molecule is
  5.6$\times$10$^{-26}$~kg.} $m$.
% WRONG VERSION. It doesn't depend on number density!!
% that nature picks $v_s$ based on the air temperature $T$ and number
% density\footnote{``Number density'' meaning ``the number of air molecules and
%   atoms that fit in a box of a size that we agree upon.'' For example we could
%   use a box with dimensions 1~cm~$\times$~1~cm~$\times$~1~cm, which is 1 cm$^3$,
%   or a cubic centimeter. If you stuck a box of this size into the open air and
%   did some counting, you would find roughly \numprint{25000000000000000000}
%   molecules and atoms inside, or $n$ = 2.5$\times$~10$^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$.} $n$.

We're all grown-ups here, so let me show you exactly what I mean. Try
the following definition\footnote{This is the definition appropriate for an
  ideal gas. I've replaced the usual adiabatic index $\gamma$ with 1.4, which is
  roughly true for diatomic molecules when $T = 0 ^{\circ}$C, and
  $k_B \simeq$~1.38$\times$10$^{-23}$~J/K.} of $v_s$ on for size:
\begin{equation}
  \label{ch1:eqvsreal}
  v_s (T,m) = \sqrt{\dfrac{1.4 k_B T}{m}}.
\end{equation}
What you see in (\ref{ch1:eqvsreal}) is the explicit demonstration of what I
already mentioned---that the speed of sound depends on air temperature and the
(average) mass of an air molecule. And I think you'll agree that
(\ref{ch1:eqvsreal}) makes sense: If $T = 0$~K, $v_s = 0$; i.e., there are no sound
waves. On the other hand as $m$ increases, $v_s$ decreases.

What to conclude? That the properties of a system determine how (or perhaps
whether) it resonates. Stated in alternate fashion, \emph{the system properties
  determine the dispersion relation}.  As another example, if you pluck a guitar
string it will pick a single frequency (and probably harmonics) at which to
resonate based on the string tension as well as how thick and how long the
string is.\footnote{Look up standing waves on a string. It's a classic in
  introductory physics courses.} That's the system---a string fixed at two
ends. Like we discussed in the last section, there is a whole spectrum of
frequencies and wavelengths that the air allows, including the whole range of
human hearing,\footnote{My own unfounded speculation is that humans must have
  evolved to hear over the range of frequencies that carry information most
  meaningful to our survival. However, I am not ignorant of those without
  hearing, and the words of Nietzsche in \textit{Menschliches,
    Allzumenschliches} come to mind: ``There is rarely a degeneration, a
  truncation, or even a vice or any physical or moral loss without an advantage
  somewhere else. In a warlike and restless clan, for example, the sicklier may
  have occasion to be alone, and may therefore become quieter and wiser; the
  one-eyed will have one eye the stronger; the blind will see deeper inwardly,
  and certainly hear better. To this extent, the famous theory of the survival
  of the fittest does not seem to me to be the only viewpoint from which to
  explain the progress of strengthening of [\dots] a race.''} and much more. But
equations (\ref{ch1:eqvomegak}) and (\ref{ch1:eqvsreal}) say that no matter how
you slice it, the waves move at the constant speed $v_s$.

It doesn't have to be so simple, you know. Instead of
equation~(\ref{ch1:eqvsreal}) I could turn up the heat in a
generalized\footnote{In physics speak, the word ``generalized'' signals to all
  physicists in the area that the ideas are about to become far-reaching, or
  impossible to comprehend, or worse, descend into quackery. It's a word that
  can only be taken on a case-by-case basis, so beware!}  way, and tell you
something like
\begin{equation}
  \label{ch1:eqvsgen}
  v_s = v_s (T, m),
\end{equation}
which is wonderfully vague. It looks meaningless, doesn't it? But no--it's
telling you that the ``the speed of sound is related to air temperature and the
mass of an air molecule,'' just like equation~(\ref{ch1:eqvsreal}). The
difference is that (\ref{ch1:eqvsgen}) hasn't bothered to specify the
relationship between system variables and the speed of sound, and instead only
states that a relationship exists.

Why? For all its vagueness equation~(\ref{ch1:eqvsgen}) buys us power to dream a
little. Suppose you and I are investigating some exotic fluid---we'll pretend
for kicks that it behaves sort of like a gas, so that it can be described by
quantities like temperature and particle mass. Let's further pretend that this
exotic fluid is made up of charged particles, so that it is also subject to
electrodynamics and can do fancy things under special conditions, like freeze a
magnetic field into itself\footnote{Within our solar system, the ``frozen
  magnetic field'' thing happens all over the neighborhood, so to speak. It is
  usually fair to describe the solar wind as an ``MHD fluid'' (discussed in the
  text) as some of us are wont to call it, with a frozen-in magnetic field whose
  field lines twist like the skirt of a ballerina as she twirls, or the water
  sprayed by the sprinkler head on your lawn as it spins. In the case of the
  solar wind, these spirals happen because of the rotation of the sun, the flow
  of the solar wind \emph{away} from the sun, and the whole ``fluid that freezes
  magnetic fields into itself'' idea.}  and conduct electrical currents.

So what might the dispersion relation, the ``updated'' version of
equation~(\ref{ch1:eqvsgen}), look like for this ungodly
``magnetohydrodynamic,''\footnote{It might surprise you that at the healthy
  length of eight syllables, this is a word that gets used regularly in plasma
  physics.} or MHD, fluid? Back in 1942 Hannes \Alf proposed
\begin{equation}
  \label{ch1:eqmhd}
  v = v ( T, m, n, B).
\end{equation}
Comparing equation \ref{ch1:eqmhd} with equation (\ref{ch1:eqvsgen}) informs you
of this: all he did was suggest additional dependence on the magnetic field $B$
and the number density\footnote{``Number density'' meaning ``the number of gas
  particles that fit in a box of a size that we agree upon.'' For example we
  could use a box with dimensions 1~cm~$\times$~1~cm~$\times$~1~cm, which is 1
  cm$^3$, or a cubic centimeter. If you stuck a box of this size into the open
  air and did some counting, you would find roughly
  \numprint{25000000000000000000} molecules inside, or $n$ =
  2.5$\times$~10$^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$.} of particles $n$!  The reasons why he
suggested this dependence, though, are more sophisticated than his simply
``taking a crack at it'' and shoving some extra alphabet letters into the
right-hand side of (\ref{ch1:eqvsgen}).\footnote{A good, old-fashioned wild
  guess is nonetheless a respectable strategy when attacking, for instance,
  nonlinear differential equations; solving them seems to be the mathematician's
  equivalent of shooting beer cans off a fencepost.} He went a step further and
nailed down an explicit dispersion relation\footnote{Some dust-bunny details are
  going under the rug, but not many, considering Alfv\'{e}n's original letter to
  \textsl{Nature} was only six paragraphs! (In case you didn't know,
  \textsl{Nature} is considered by many to be the darling of the physical
  sciences as far as publication goes, the obvious corollary being that most
  scientists have developed a strong opinion about or have emotional baggage
  related to it.)} comparable to (\ref{ch1:eqvsreal}):
\begin{equation}
  \label{ch1:eqAlf}
  \dfrac{\omega}{k_\parallel} = v_A \equiv \frac{B}{\sqrt{\mu_o m_i n}},
\end{equation}
where $v_A$ is the eponymous and rather famous \textsl{\Alf speed} (I doubt \Alf
ever called it that), $B$ is the strength of the background magnetic
field,\footnote{When physicists talk about a ``background'' element of their
  storyboard, they usually mean that that element is changing slowly enough
  compared to whatever they want to investigate that it makes more sense to
  treat the element as static in time. For equation (\ref{ch1:eqAlf}), \Alf was
  assuming the presence of a background (or static) magnetic field.} and $m_i$
and $n$ are the mass and number density of the ions that make up the fluid.

If you are paying close attention to (\ref{ch1:eqAlf}), you might wonder why I
choose to mark ion mass with the subscript `$i$', but not the ion number
density. The short answers are these: We only care about ions when it comes to
mass, and we care about ions \emph{and} electrons when it comes to number
density.

I recognize the short answers probably fall short of helpful, so let's expand:
First, we only care about the ion mass $m_i$ (and ignore the electron mass,
$m_e$) in equation (\ref{ch1:eqAlf}) because as you may know, even the smallest
ion\footnote{Naked hydrogen, which is just a proton.} outweighs an electron by a
factor of almost two thousand.\footnote{To be a bit more exact the
  proton-to-electron mass ratio is \numprint{1836.15267389}(17), according to
  the \textsl{2014 CODATA recommended values.}}

``Fair enough,'' you say, ``but why no subscript on the number density $n$?  Why
not write `$n_i$' instead of writing `$n$'? We only care about ions, right?''
Aha! If there were \emph{only} ions present, and no electrons to counterbalance
the mutual repulsion of the positively charged ions, you can easily appreciate
that we couldn't have this conversation: ions simply would not hang around each
other without the presence of a roughly equal number electrons. The presence of
roughly equal numbers of both positive and negative particles---ions and
electrons---is a condition known as \emph{quasineutrality} among plasma
physicists. More formally stated,
\begin{equation}
  \label{ch1:eqQuasi}
  n_i \approx n_e.
\end{equation}
Since the ion number density $n_i$ and the electron number density $n_e$ are
more or less the same throughout the plasma, we don't bother making a
distinction between the number densities $n_i$ and $n_e$; in other words, we are
satisfied with the approximation $n_i = n_e = n$.\footnote{Be aware that this
  is a white lie; it is a good approximation in a lot of situations, but it
  certainly not true in every situation.}

One more point of trickery, this time on an important difference between the
parallel wave number $k_\parallel$ that you see in the denominator of the
left-hand side of (\ref{ch1:eqAlf}), and the wave number $k$ that you see in
(\ref{ch1:eqvomegak}): The subscript, $\parallel$, informs you that the wave in
question is propagating (i.e., physics speak for ``moving'') in a particular
direction---\emph{along} the magnetic field.\footnote{In plasma physics,
  whenever the subscripts $\parallel$ and $\perp$ (``parallel'' and
  ``perpendicular'', as you probably guessed) start appearing, they indicate the
  orientation or measurement of the quantity in question relative to the
  geometry of the local magnetic field.}

The idea of a preferred direction of propagation is not totally foreign to you,
even if you don't recognize it immediately. For example, if you want to get your
friend's attention with a whistle or a shout, why do you turn your head to face
them? Presumably because you know that there is a better chance to be heard if
you whistle or shout in your friend's direction. \textit{Voil\`{a}}---you
understand that there \emph{can be} a preferred direction of wave
propagation. Notice, however, that information about the direction of
propagation is utterly absent in
(\ref{ch1:eqvs})--(\ref{ch1:eqvsreal}).\footnote{If we wanted to theoretically
  investigate, for example, how far a wave could propagate before dissipating
  into thermal noise (which is something like air friction), we would need to
  supplement the foregoing dispersion relations with equations describing how a
  sound wave interacts with a gas as it propagates---stuff like wave energy and
  wave spreading. For examples that can only be described as awesome, you could
  check out Sir Geoffrey Taylor's [\citeyear{Taylor1950},\citeyear{Taylor1950a}]
  famous papers dealing with the propagation of a nuclear blast wave. The first
  is thorough and necessary, while the second, in my opinion, is elegant; to
  read it borders on pleasure.}

% A preferred direction of propagation is probably a little difficult to
% appreciate. To illustrate the difference, consider what happens when you drop a
% pebble in a still pond. The ripples move outward from the point on the
% surface where you dropped the pebble, and if the pond is truly
% still, the ripples are concentric---that is, no particular direction  that \Alf waves, however,
% \emph{do} have a preference: along magnetic field lines. The idea is shown in
% Figure~\ref{ch1:FigAlfProp}.

I've been slinging details, but don't let them cause you to to miss the
point. The dispersion relation (\ref{ch1:eqAlf}) is \emph{identical} in form to
equation~(\ref{ch1:eqvomegak}). To wit,\footnote{An expression frequently
  employed by D.J. Griffiths, the celebrated author of undergraduate physics
  textbooks. (If you don't believe me that textbook authors are on the level of
  celebrities or---dare I betray the pettiness of scientists?---public enemies,
  ask physics majors what classes they are taking. Then ask about the textbook
  for each class, and how these majors feel about each textbook author.)}
$ \omega / k = $(some speed). You should be aware of something else: \Alf
obtained the result (\ref{ch1:eqAlf}) by assuming that there \emph{is} a fluid
(translation: $n >$~0) whose constituent particles are not massless
(translation: $m >$~0) and that a magnetic field $B$ exists in the fluid. As
soon as we start two-timing on equation (\ref{ch1:eqAlf}) and telling it that
$B =$~0, or that $n =$~0 or $m =$~0, violating the assumptions that brought it
into being, equation (\ref{ch1:eqAlf}) seeks to repay the favor by helpfully
informing you either that $v_A =$~0 or that $v_A =$~(nonsense). Give it a shot:
plug $B =$~0 into (\ref{ch1:eqAlf}). See? $v_A =$~ 0.\footnote{This result makes
  sense: No magnetic field (translation: $B =$~0) means the \Alf speed
  $v_A =$~0, which means no \Alf waves.}  Now try the other two options by
plugging $m =$~0 or $n =$~0 into (\ref{ch1:eqAlf}). See?
$v_A =$~(nonsense).\footnote{Instead of just writing the situation off as
  nonsense, a more interesting route would be to imagine a plasma such that the
  ion mass, number density, and magnetic field were such that the \Alf speed
  approached the speed of light, in which case things get relativistic---you
  know, \textit{\`{a} la} Einstein---in which case \citet{Gedalin1993} has
  reported that the dispersion relation (\ref{ch1:eqAlf}) is rather expressed
  $\omega / k = c \sqrt{B^2/\mu_o / (B^2/\mu_o + \epsilon + P)}$. (You'll need
  to visit \citeauthor{Gedalin1993}'s [1993] treatise if you want to know more;
  I mention it here to give you the flavor of other
  possibilities.)}% \footnote{Siri has explained a form of this phenomenon thus:
  % ``Imagine that you have zero cookies and you split them evenly among zero
  % friends. How many cookies does each person get? See? It doesn't make
  % sense. And Cookie Monster is sad that there are no cookies, and you are sad
  % that you have no friends.'' A more interesting route would be to imagine a
  % plasma such that the ion mass, number density, and magnetic field were such
  % that the \Alf speed approached the speed of light, in which case
  % \citet{Gedalin1993} has reported that the dispersion relation
  % (\ref{ch1:eqAlf}) is rather
  % $\omega / k = c \sqrt{B^2/\mu_o / (B^2/\mu_o + \epsilon + P)}$. (Gonna have to
  % visit \citeauthor{Gedalin1993}'s [1993] treatise if you want to know more.)}

Finally, to bring you up to speed, there is a mountain of
textbooks and peer-reviewed literature that refer to the \Alf speed and
(surprise!) \Alf waves. Why? In his review of experiments dealing with \Alf
waves, \cite{Gekelman1999} put it this way: ``These waves are ubiquitous in
space plasmas and are the means by which information about changing currents and
magnetic fields are communicated.''\footnote{There are also tip-top reviews and
  reports of \Alf waves in the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and the region in
  between \citep{Stasiewicz2000,Berthomier2011,Mottez2015}, in the magnetotail
  \citep{Keiling2009}, at the Sun \citep{Mathioudakis2013}, in various
  combinations of all of these places \citep{Wu2016a}, and even around
  otherworldly objects like neutrino stars \citep{Thompson1996}. If you wanted a
  summary of the entire scientific enterprise surrounding \Alf waves, you might
  have a look at \citeauthor{Cramer2001}'s [2001] expansive review of the
  subject.}

In fact, with the solitary exception of chapter~6, gratuitous references to \Alf
this-and-that are found throughout the chapters comprising this thesis; I doubt
if there are more than five total pages in chapters 2--6 that fail to mention
the name.

\section[When dispersion relations become dispersive]{When dispersion relations
  become dispersive\protect{\footnote{*gasp!*}}}

Let's summarize in a few points what we just picked up.
\begin{itemize}
% \item The relationship between spatial and temporal frequencies of waves 
\item The properties of a system (e.g., temperature, density, magnetic field
  strength) determine the speed of wave propagation.
\item The most basic wave mode that exists in a neutral gas is a wave of
  pressure pulsations, otherwise known as a sound wave.
\item The \Alf wave is a basic wave mode that exists in a \textsl{quasineutral}
  plasma when a background magnetic field is present.\footnote{There are one or
    two other basic wave modes we could talk about; you'll find the discussion
    of them in any introductory text on magnetohydrodynamics.}
\item In their simplest form, \Alf waves propagate along magnetic field lines.
\item Physicists use \textsl{dispersion relations}, which are dependent on the
  properties of a system (among other things), to describe how wave modes
  propagate within that system.\footnote{Dispersion relations can also describe
    how different wave modes couple, how different systems couple (e.g., how a
    vibrating guitar string causes the air to vibrate), and the energy transfer
    between particles and waves in the same system or different systems.}
\end{itemize}

To introduce the present topic, which is \emph{wave dispersion}, notice that
(\ref{ch1:eqvomegak}) and (\ref{ch1:eqAlf}) both describe waves that propagate
at a constant speed ($v_s$ in regular old air and $v_A$ in a magnetized plasma)
no matter what the wave number or frequency of the waves in question. We need to
emphasize this: the wave speeds described by the dispersion relations
(\ref{ch1:eqvomegak}) and (\ref{ch1:eqAlf}) are \emph{independent of wave number
  and frequency}, which is to say that they are \emph{nondispersive}. 

Does it feel like a contradiction in terms to describe nondispersive waves using
a dispersion relation? If so, you may be comforted to know that
(\ref{ch1:eqvomegak}) and (\ref{ch1:eqAlf}) still achieve the purpose of a
dispersion relation that I originally stated, which is specification of the
relationship between wave number and frequency as a function of system
properties. Remember what I stated about $\lambda$ and $f$ being inversely
proportional---or equivalently, that $\omega$ and $k$ are directly
proportional---when we discussed (\ref{ch1:eqvsdiff})? Even that basic statement
constitutes a dispersion relation.

You might ask, ``So wait---I understand that (\ref{ch1:eqvomegak}) and
(\ref{ch1:eqAlf}) are examples of some sort of fringe case in which waves aren't
dispersive, but all that tells me is what dispersive waves \emph{aren't}. Can we
venture out of the negative space and into the positive?'' Your wish is my
command.

Imagine waves traveled at a speed proportional to their frequency so that
higher-frequency waves consistently arrived before waves at lower
frequencies. Your experience at a live concert could be rather different,
depending on how close you were to the performers: audience members on the
front-row might have a shot at a coherent experience, but people in the
nosebleeds would run the risk of hearing the violas about a second or two after
they heard the violins!\footnote{The element of surprise in Haydn's famed
  ``Surprise'' symphony would be a rather difficult, and conceivably impossible,
  feat to achieve. Never mind evenly arpeggiated chords, and coherent runs and
  fast improvisation would be right out.} Why? In my contrived example with wave
speed proportional to frequency, the C produced by bowing the lowest string of a
cello (otherwise known as $\textrm{C}_3$) would take twice as long\footnote{As
  you know, the frequency of the first octave above a particular note is double
  the frequency (e.g., the frequency of middle C, or $\textrm{C}_4$ is about
  262~Hz, and the frequency of the open note produced by an openly bowed first
  string of a viola, $\textrm{C}_3$, is $\sim$131~Hz.} to reach your ears as the
lowest C playable by a violin ($\textrm{C}_4$, which is middle C). Take this
fictitious little example as an instantiation of strong\footnote{Before you
  accuse me of tacking a content-free adjective like ``strong'' onto dispersion,
  be aware that in the literature of space physics, this adverb and others like
  it are often intended to signal an effect or phenomenon that we cannot gloss
  over or ignore in understanding the physical picture being presented. I have
  used the phrase ``strongly dispersive'' to present a (hypothetical) situation
  in which sound waves are dispersive to a degree that is totally unfamiliar to
  humans.}  dispersion.

It now behooves us to get on a nittier, grittier level with \Alf waves. I have
now exhausted my stores of knowledge on sound waves, and I'm afraid I'm under
necessity of submerging you in plasma---theory, that is---and subjecting you to
the harsh reality that by the numbers, the universe at present likes plasma
much, much more than it likes the ocean of neutral gas that we live
under.\footnote{People like Dennis Gallagher propound the idea that 99\% or more
  is made up of plasma, which is not hard to believe even if one only takes a
  stroll around our solar system.} We have to wander outside the realm of
direct, or at least regular, human experience, where as far as any human that
has investigated (and of whom I am aware) can tell, in many situations the
universe would not care if our nosebleed symphony experience were confused and
upset by wave dispersion; that is, examples of dispersive waves are easy to find
in nature. 

Call our situation as humans whatever you want---chance, good luck, providence,
order within chaos,\footnote{Regarding humans themselves, I realize a case could
  be made for oppositely ordering these words.}  hyper-order within order, or
the only plausible scenario\footnote{By definition!}---the fact is that when we
carefully do the science, it turns out our almost exclusively
\emph{nondispersive} experience with sound waves is not representative of the
way various types of waves behave in plasmas,\footnote{As a solitary example,
  see \citeauthor{Stix1962}'s [1962] famous treatise on waves in plasmas.}
solids,\footnote{A classic example of the is the dispersion relation for
  vibrations in Peter Debye's model of a solid; his model and related extensions
  (say, Sommerfeld's model of fermions) predict, for example, the heat capacity
  of a solid.}, or neutral fluids, including air itself.\footnote{In fact, no
  earlier than 2008 \citeauthor{Alvarez2008} gave a general dispersion relation
  for sound waves in air, which they show to be accurate for a variety of
  humidities and frequencies.}  I mean, come on---the reason rainbows appear in
the sky?  Dispersion of the electromagnetic waves we call
light!\footnote{Refraction is the answer from your high-school or freshman
  physics class, and that's right, but refraction itself is a result of
  dispersion.}

In order to forge ahead (and especially to understand what we discuss in
upcoming chapters), we've got to develop some understanding about what causes
wave dispersion, and such as my craft is, we've got to do it in the context of
plasma physics. Never fear! Many faithful guides have made the trek before us;
we're going to follow a few in right now, in fact: \citet{Goertz1979}, and
\citet{Kletzing1994}. My presentation is essentially a rip-off of theirs,
supplemented with commentary at the level of junior trail boss. Boots on?

\subsection[A ``big wheel'' derivation of the IAW dispersion
relation]{A ``big wheel''\protect{\footnote{Remember that trike with
      the fat wheel up front that your neighbor had when you were
      three?}} derivation of the inertial \Alf wave dispersion
  relation}

The math is about to get girthy---pack some real \emph{oomph}---and since a
proper, from-the-ground-up explanation would drag both of us into a mud bog
filled with heaving, steamy piles of calculus I will simply present the math in
full gore and comment upon the meaning as we go.\footnote{I used the 6th edition
  of James Stewart's \textsl{Calculus} to pick up the fundamentals as an
  undergraduate. Later on, I used (as has some non-negligible majority of
  physics majors in the past two decades) D.J. Griffiths's \textsl{Introduction
    to Electrodynamics} to develop vector calculus chops. Would I recommend
  them? Heartily.} That said, we serve ourselves well to mark our destination at
the outset. Here is the goal:
\begin{equation}
  \label{ch1:eqIAW}
  % \dfrac{\omega}{k_\parallel} = v_A \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{1 + k_\perp^2 \lambda_e^2}}
  % \dfrac{\omega}{k_\parallel} = v_A \big ( 1 + k_\perp^2 \lambda_e^2 \big )^{-1/2}
  \dfrac{\omega}{k_\parallel} = \dfrac{v_A}{ \sqrt{1 + k_\perp^2 \lambda_e^2 }}
\end{equation}

Not bad as I made it sound, right? Equation (\ref{ch1:eqIAW}) is the dispersion
relation for---guess what?---\emph{dispersive} \Alf waves, and more particularly
\emph{inertial \Alf waves} (I'll refer to them as IAWs),\footnote{This is just
  one of the flavors that dispersive \Alf waves come in. If you aren't satisfied
  with merely walking the beaten path and tend to prefer craggier climbs and
  more majestic views, you might follow \citeauthor{Lysak1996}'s [1996]
  \emph{generalized}(!) approach to dispersive \Alf waves. The bonus vista is
  discussion of imaginary terms for wave growth and damping.} in which you
immediately recognize the definition of the \Alf speed $v_A$ given in
(\ref{ch1:eqAlf}).  But oh---what's that $\perp$ doing, dangling off $k$ on the
right-hand side of (\ref{ch1:eqIAW})?  That, \textit{mes cheres amis}, indicates
the wave number that is \emph{perpendicular} to the magnetic field line. 

I hear you saying, ``But, but''---I know. I said that \Alf waves like to
propagate \emph{along} field lines, not across them. In the spirit of
Epimenides\footnote{The compatriot-slandering (and possibly mythical)
  philosopher credited with the statement that all Cretans are liars.} I tell
you, all physicists are liars and purveyors of half truths.\footnote{And in the
  spirit of Zeno, I ask: If a full truth exists and a physicist only reveals
  half, and a short while after the first revelation reveals only half of that
  which remains to be disclosed, and this pattern is continued \textit{ad
    infinitum}, may one ever hope to learn the full truth from a physicist?} A
portion of the undisclosed truth during our chat about the \Alf speed near
(\ref{ch1:eqAlf}) is that \Alf waves certainly can propagate at angles to the
magnetic field; they are more generally known as shear \Alf waves, and there is
a good body of literature showing the connection between shear \Alf waves and
IAWs.\footnote{Just a sampling:
  \citet{Heyvaerts1983,Lysak1996,Rankin1999,Drozdenko2000,Vincena2004,Tsiklauri2005,Chaston2007d,Watt2009}. Believe
  it.}

The layers of complication are that there are now \emph{two} terms involving
wave number, $k_\perp$ and $k_\parallel$, and the new term in parentheses
involving $k_\perp \lambda_e$, which serves to \emph{reduce} the \Alf speed
(observe: when $k_\perp \lambda_e \gtrsim$~1, the whole factor multiplying $v_A$
is less than 1). They aren't much to be worried about, but I should be careful
to point out that I have not said (and unfortunately will not say) \emph{a
  thing} about how to generate these waves. Many of the references given in the
footnotes are great resources on this topic, as are the aforementioned work by
\citet{Lysak1996} and \citet{Genot2004a}.

% So let's open the bag and let the first cat out: $k_\parallel$ represents the
% wave number (which you recall from Section~\ref{subsec:k} is just the inverse of
% wavelength multiplied by 2$\pi$) that is parallel to the magnetic field.

% So let's open the bag and let the first cat out: $k_\parallel$ represents the
% wave number that is parallel to the magnetic field.

% We need to look at that old plasma theorist's standby, the continuity
% equation.
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{ch1:eqCont}
%   J_{E} = J_{E,\textrm{100--200 eV}} + J_{E,\textrm{200--500 eV}} + J_{E,\textrm{500--1200 eV}} + \dots .
% \end{equation}

Now I'll introduce you to two of the old plasma theorist's standbys,
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align} 
    \dfrac{\partial n_{\alpha}}{\partial t} + \grad \cdot \big (n_{\alpha} \mathbf{v}_{\alpha} \big ) &= 0, \label{ch1:eqCont} \\
    m_{\alpha} n_{\alpha} \dfrac{\partial \mathbf{v}_{\alpha}}{\partial t} &=
    q_{\alpha} n_{\alpha} \Big ( \mathbf{E} + \dfrac{1}{c} \mathbf{v}_{\alpha}
    \times \mathbf{B} \Big ), \label{ch1:eqMom}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
% \begin{subequations}
%   \begin{align} 
%     \dfrac{\partial n_{\alpha}}{\partial t} + \grad \cdot \big (n_{\alpha} \mathbf{v}_{\alpha} \big ) &= 0, \label{ch1:eqCont} \\
%     m_{\alpha} n_{\alpha} \Big ( \dfrac{\partial
%     \mathbf{v}_{\alpha}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v}_{\alpha} \cdot \grad
%     \mathbf{v}_{\alpha} \Big ) + \grad p_{\alpha} + \grad \cdot
%     \overleftrightarrow{\Pi}_{\alpha} &= q_{\alpha} n_{\alpha} \Big
%                                             ( \mathbf{E} + \dfrac{1}{c}
%                                             \mathbf{v}_{\alpha} \times
%                                             \mathbf{B} \Big ) +
%                                             \mathbf{F}_{\alpha}, \label{ch1:eqMom}
%   \end{align}
% \end{subequations}
which are respectively the continuity equation and the momentum equation. (The
latter is sometimes affectionately referred to as the ``mom equation.'' In order
to focus on the physics of interest I have thrown away a bunch of terms
describing the effects of pressure and other, external forces.) They will serve
as our description of the way that the collection of particles constituting our
plasma respond to each other (``internal forces''), including the electric and
magnetic fields that a plasma can internally sustain, and to external forces,
like a background magnetic field.

You can see that the key players in the continuity equation (\ref{ch1:eqCont})
are $n_{\alpha}$ and $\mathbf{v}_{\alpha}$, which are number density and
velocity. In the plainest English I can muster, (\ref{ch1:eqCont}) simply says
that no particles are created or destroyed within the system under
investigation. ``Um, `system under investigation?' \dots'' Don't be baffled by
my language. When I say ``system''\footnote{Others might use ``setup'' or
  ``configuration'' instead of ``system.'' They're all the same in this
  context.} all I mean is the cast of characters, the amount of time and space,
and the level of detail necessary to execute an investigation of the science
question I have in mind. Here, our cast members are electrons and ions that are
subject to a background magnetic field and mutual effects of attraction and
repulsion, but are otherwise free to move. This cast turns out to be a pretty
excellent description of much of what goes on within and around the terrestrial
magnetosphere, as well as in the solar wind.

``But how many electrons and ions, and over what period of time and what region
of space?'' Prepare for a level of freedom that is often unsettling for
newcomers: we have $N$ electrons and ions, and as much time and space as we
need. (We're just scratching on notepads and paper at this point, so let's dream
big!) At this stage we don't need to worry about those types of details; save
those worries for \emph{application},\footnote{Or if you're a theorist, leave
  all the worrying to the experimentalists! They'll let you know where you
  screwed up or weren't detailed enough.} when we want to apply our theoretical
results to a particular situation.

As long as we're talking in broad terms, what about the subscript $\alpha$?
It can indicate electrons or ions (i.e, $\alpha = e,i$). To be more
explicit, whenever you see the subscript $\alpha$ you should be cognizant
that there are really \emph{two} equations on display---one for electrons and
one for ions---but we're using $\alpha$ to keep things compact. My
dual-purpose of $\alpha$ is an example of what physicists might refer to as
``notational convenience.'' Go ahead---impress your friends when they ask about
$\alpha$.

But where were we? Oh, yes---as far as (\ref{ch1:eqCont}) is
concerned,\footnote{And of course neglecting whatever the momentum equation
  (\ref{ch1:eqMom}) dictates about particle motion.}  particles are free to move
all over the system---bunch into heaping piles, spread out uniformly, and so
on---but if we start with $N$ total particles, we must end with $N$ particles,
let $n_{\alpha}(\mathbf{x},t)$ change how it will.\footnote{In math speak I
  am saying that from eternity to eternity,
  $\int_{\mathrm{sys}} d^3\mathbf{x} \, n(\mathbf{x},t) = N$ regardless of the
  variation of number density in time and space within the confines of our
  system.}

How about the momentum equation? 

Two questions now arise. They are questions so worthy that if you haven't
thought to ask, I'm asking on behalf of us all: Where did (\ref{ch1:eqCont}) and
(\ref{ch1:eqMom}) come from? Are they laws of some sort? 

To the first question, (\ref{ch1:eqCont}) and (\ref{ch1:eqMom}) came from the
\emph{Vlasov equation}, also known as the ``collisionless Boltzmann
equation.''\footnote{Wanna see it?  Here's the nonrelativistic version:
  $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial
    \mathbf{x}} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{v}}$.
  $f = f (\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{v}, t)$ is known as a distribution function, and
  it gives the density of particles at $\mathbf{x}$---which is the position
  vector---having velocity $\mathbf{v}$.} The Vlasov equation completely ignores
particle-particle (or pair) collisions. (Hence the ``collisionless'' in
``collisionless Boltzmann equation.'') Believe it or not, it is often valid to
assume space plasmas are collisionless.\footnote{But not always!  When the
  assumption is not valid one turns of necessity to the ``collisionful'' (my own
  neologism) Boltzmann equation, which is known for leaving bruised, black-eyed,
  and bloodied physicists in its wake.} On the other hand, the Vlasov equation
allows for long-range\footnote{As opposed to ``short-range'' interaction, or
  direct collisions between particles.}  interaction between all particles via
the Coulomb force.\footnote{The eponymous Coulomb force, after Charles-Augustin
  de Coulomb, just describes the repulsive or attractive force between charged
  particles: $F_{\textrm{Coul}} = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$. Can you see that the
  force is positive (i.e., repulsive) if $q_1$ and $q_2$ have the same sign, and
  negative (i.e., attractive) otherwise? Coulomb's law is scientific bedrock.}

To the second question, I suppose in a manner of speaking we could call
(\ref{ch1:eqCont}) and (\ref{ch1:eqMom}) laws---or rather, you can think of them
as true statements with the following proviso: At no point in the course of our
using (\ref{ch1:eqCont}) and (\ref{ch1:eqMom}) are we permitted to treat a
situation violating the assumptions that brought them about, which I summarized
in the previous paragraph. I am not going to launch into an exposition of the
Vlasov equation, or else we'd never get out of here,\footnote{You can turn to
  someone like \citet{Chen1974} or \citet{Bellan2008} for that.} but I will
broadly warn that we wander into dangerous territory when we take imprudent
liberty and practice Blind application Of Formulas---let's call it ``boffing,''
and those who practice it ``boffers.'' I will try to point out where the
unsuspecting may be led into boffing, though all the ways in which one might
possibly boff are far too many to hope to enumerate, or (as I have learned by
sad experience) even know.\footnote{Undergraduates are among the most expert
  boffers, having seemingly limitless capacity to sleuth out and demonstrate new
  ways to boff. It is tempting to believe (though I know better) that they take
  up boffing as an innocent-seeming, though ultimately sinister, pastime
  calculated to harm their physics professors and teaching assistants.}

I would not leave you hanging without at least one concrete example to
demonstrate when one ought to become suspicious of (\ref{ch1:eqCont}) and
(\ref{ch1:eqMom}): the ionosphere. In the ionosphere, where the electron number
density is waaay higher than in the magnetosphere, the total number of particles
$N$ can change all the time\footnote{I.e., the right-hand side of
  (\ref{ch1:eqCont}) is not zero.} as a result of---oh, I don't know, how about
sunlight-induced photoionization of ionospheric particles? Strictly speaking,
when the total number of particles changes the continuity equation
(\ref{ch1:eqCont}) is no longer true.

In short, once we have decided to make the assumptions that make
(\ref{ch1:eqCont}) and (\ref{ch1:eqMom}) valid, there's no going back; we can't
introduce elements to our model that end up violating those assumptions. And now
you know: (\ref{ch1:eqCont}) and (\ref{ch1:eqMom}) are \emph{not} always
true. They are not laws of nature, but they tell us how particles move around in
a plasma in situations where it is safe to neglect particle-particle collisions,
and where the number of particles $N$ is sufficiently large to render valid a
statistical treatment of the plasma.\footnote{You'd have to venture into a
  textbook on statistical mechanics to get a feel for what it means for $N$ to
  be ``sufficiently large.''}

Fewf! This is a good place to stop and do some ruminating, both on what I've
just told you and on a sandwich, if so inclined. Otherwise, let's continue.

Besides (\ref{ch1:eqCont}) and (\ref{ch1:eqMom}), we need two of Maxwell's
equations,\footnote{The four laws constituting Maxwell's equations---Gauss's
  law, Divergenceless B, Faraday's law, and Amp\`{e}re's law---are the
  foundation of classical electrodynamics. As gates of understanding through
  which all would-be physicists must pass, and given both their ubiquity and
  their overall degree of importance in more fields than I am aware exist, in my
  opinion emotional and reverential responses to the mention of their names are
  not improper.}
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align} \grad \times \mathbf{E} &= - \dfrac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}; \label{ch1:eqFar} \\
    \grad \times \mathbf{B} &= \mu_o \mathbf{J}. \label{ch1:eqAmp}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
In contrast to (\ref{ch1:eqCont}) and (\ref{ch1:eqMom}) which I continue to
emphasize are \emph{not} laws of nature, (\ref{ch1:eqFar}) and (\ref{ch1:eqAmp})
\emph{are} laws. As far as I know, they are genuinely immutable.\footnote{Some
  of you will note I've discarded Maxwell's famous addition to
  (\ref{ch1:eqAmp}), the displace current $\mu_o \epsilon_o \frac{\partial
    \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$. We're assuming our system evolves slowly enough
  that we can neglect it.}

The first of these, (\ref{ch1:eqFar}) or Faraday's law, is telling you that
wherever you see an electric field having nonzero curl,\footnote{The concept of
  ``curl''---represented in (\ref{ch1:eqFar}) and (\ref{ch1:eqAmp}) as $\grad
  \times$---comes from vector calculus, but you and I know that vector calculus
  is totally contrived, a concession to our human inabilities to think of a
  better description! I attempt to momentarily circumvent this human limitation:
  Can you imagine a tornado? If so, imagine further the flow of winds around the
  eye of a tornado; they swirl around the eye of the tornado, right? Well,
  that's a cheap example of a curling, or ``vortical,'' field of vectors. (The
  vector field in this case is fluid flow.) } somewhere in the vicinity there is
a corresponding magnetic field changing in time. The second, (\ref{ch1:eqAmp})
or Amp\`{e}re's law, is telling you that a magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ with
nonzero curl is the same as, and cannot be separated from, a current density
$\mathbf{J}$---up to a constant of proportionality $\mu_o$, at any
rate. Together, (\ref{ch1:eqFar}) and (\ref{ch1:eqAmp}) tell us how electric
fields and magnetic fields evolve in time, and they are \emph{laws}. 

Now for the fun part. We get to make a bunch of assumptions about the way that
magnetic and electric fields vary in time, how the constituent particle species
(which are ions and electrons) move and interact, whether or not we allow what
in the biz we call \emph{nonlinear terms}\footnote{Nonlinear terms involve
  products and/or quotients of variables (e.g., $xy$ or $x/y$) instead of sums
  and differences (e.g., $x+y$ or $x-y$). They are the fastest, most basic, and
  most obvious route to making a theoretical problem intractable that I am aware
  of.}, all of which whittle away the unnecessary details of
(\ref{ch1:eqCont}--\ref{ch1:eqFar}). In other words, I suppose in making any
assumption we are hoping to save ourselves from distraction by unnecessary
details in the course of investigation.

First of all, I propose a Cartesian coordinate system\footnote{We could use a
  dipolar coordinate system, as do \citet{Lysak2013}, but I'd rather keep it
  simple for the sake of both of us.} such that the $z$ coordinate is along the
local geomagnetic field $\mathbf{B}_o$ (that is, $\mathbf{B}_o = B_o \hat{z}$),
the $x$ coordinate is perpendicular to the local geomagnetic field, and the $y$
coordinate is negligible (i.e., nothing varies in the $y$ direction, which means
that inside the symbol $\grad$, the differential operator $\partial / \partial y
= 0$). However, I won't outrightly say that the $y$ coordinate doesn't exist
since, among other issues, the curl operator $\grad \times$ is a
three-dimensional creature and doesn't make sense if we are strict in saying
that there are only two dimensions in our system.

So much for spatial variation. How about variation in time? We'll assume that
everything in our system happens slowly enough so that $\partial^2 / \partial
t^2 \ll \Omega_{ci}^2$, which is to say that variations in the electric and
magnetic field are over timescales that are much less than the ion cyclotron
period; in more practical language, I mean that we are interested in
\emph{low-frequency} oscillations. 

We're also going to assume the existence of an electric field
$\mathbf{E}_{\textrm{app}}$ that only varies in the $x-z$ plane:
$\mathbf{E}_{\textrm{app}} = \mathbf{E}_{\textrm{app}} (x, z, t)$.

Last of all, I will assume a singly charged ion species so that $q_i = q$ (and
of course $q_e = -q$).

With these assumptions let's bob and weave, baby. Start by multiplying each
continuity equation by the corresponding charge of the species
$q_\alpha$---positive for ions and negative for electrons---and adding these two
continuity equations (\ref{ch1:eqCont}) together (remember that there are really
two equations, since $\alpha$ is used to denote either electrons or ions),
\begin{equation} \label{ch1:eqCont1} \dfrac{\partial}{\partial t} \big (
  n_i - n_e \big ) + \grad \cdot \big (n_i \mathbf{v}_i - n_{e}
  \mathbf{v}_{e} \big ) = 0.
\end{equation}
If we now recall the quasineutrality condition (\ref{ch1:eqQuasi}) you can see
that the terms involving the time derivative of density go to zero, and if I
define the current density $\mathbf{j} \equiv q n ( \mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{v}_e
)$, the divergence term (that's the symbol $\grad \cdot$ and all the stuff in
parentheses that follows after) can be rewritten $\grad \cdot \mathbf{j}$:
\begin{equation} \label{ch1:eqCont1} \dfrac{\partial}{\partial t} \big (
  \cancel{n_i - n_e} \big ) + \grad \cdot \big (n_i \mathbf{v}_i - n_{e}
  \mathbf{v}_{e} \big ) = \grad \cdot \mathbf{j} = 0.
\end{equation}


For to-be-disclosed reasons, I take the time derivative of $\grad \cdot
\mathbf{j} = 0$ and write out the components of the divergence term
\emph{as\'{i}}:
\begin{equation} \label{ch1:eqCont2} \dfrac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial t}
  j_x + \dfrac{\partial^2}{\partial z \partial t} j_z = 0.
\end{equation}
You'll recall that our assumption, $\partial / \partial y = 0$, accounts for the
conspicuous absence of any terms or derivatives involving $y$. Let's keep this
equation in our back pocket and keep moving.

How about taking a look at the $y$ component of the momentum equations
(\ref{ch1:eqMom})? This suggestion might seem strange since I've explicitly
assumed that $\partial / \partial y = 0$, but hang on to your hat: writing out
the $y$ components, we find that
\begin{equation} 
  \begin{alignedat}{2}
    \label{ch1:eqMomy} \dfrac{\partial v_{\textrm{e}y}}{\partial t} &=
    - &\dfrac{q}{m_e}v_{\textrm{e}x} ~ B_o &= 0; \\
    \dfrac{\partial v_{\textrm{i}y}}{\partial t} &=
    &\dfrac{q}{m_i}v_{\textrm{i}x} ~ B_o &= 0. \\
  \end{alignedat}
\end{equation}
Why are the right-hand sides of (\ref{ch1:eqMomy}) 0? Well, if they weren't zero
the possibility of a time-varying current density $j_y \neq 0$ arises, which we
simply won't hear of! Once we're through with this derivation you'll see that a
time-varying $j_y$ is unnecessary to include, and in the meantime I ask you to
trust that I have the benefit of foresight. Plus, this assumptions lets us
equate the two expressions (\ref{ch1:eqMomy}) to find that
\begin{equation} 
  v_{\textrm{e}x} = - \dfrac{m_e}{m_i} v_{\textrm{i}x}.
\end{equation}
% Wait, did you just miss something? Oh, right---you're wondering why the shortage
% of a species-specifying subscript (alliterate!) on $v_y$. Doubtless you remember
% all those things I was saying about making life easy via simplifying
% assumptions; $v_y$ is Exhibit A, a ramification of my decision to set $\partial
% / \partial y = 0$---or rather, the assumption $\partial / \partial y = 0$
% obviously means that $\partial v_{\textrm{e}y} / \partial y = \partial
% v_{\textrm{i}y} / \partial y = 0$, and that there is no need for specifying a
% species because derivatives with respect to $y$ are all zero anyway.
Ah, so! It turns out that in the $x$ direction electron motion is opposite that
of the ions, and at a speed that is less than that of ions by a factor of $m_e /
m_i$. (In plain English: electrons move much, much more slowly than ions in the
$x$ direction.) This is somewhat counterintuitive since electrons are much
lighter than ions and presumably a lot easier to shove around, but that's often why
we need the math to guide when intuition is faulty.

Next, why don't we take a look at the $x$ component of the momentum equations
(\ref{ch1:eqMom})? They are
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned} \label{ch1:eqMomx} \dfrac{\partial v_{\textrm{ex}}}{\partial t} &= \dfrac{q_e E_x}{m_e} + \dfrac{q_e}{m_e}v_y B_o; \\
    \dfrac{\partial v_{\textrm{ix}}}{\partial t} &= ~ \dfrac{q_i E_x}{m_i} + \dfrac{q_e}{m_i}v_y B_o.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Can you see that if I take the time derivative of (\ref{ch1:eqMomx}),
$\frac{\partial v_{\textrm{e}x}}{\partial t}$ and $\frac{\partial
  v_{\textrm{i}x}}{\partial t}$ will appear on the right-hand sides? In their places I
can then ladle in expressions (\ref{ch1:eqMomy}):
\begin{equation}
  % \begin{aligned} \label{ch1:eqMomxdt} 
\begin{alignedat}{5} \label{ch1:eqMomxdt} 
    \dfrac{\partial^2 v_{\textrm{ex}}}{\partial t^2} &= - &\dfrac{q}{m_e}\dfrac{\partial E_x}{\partial t} - \dfrac{q}{m_e}\dfrac{\partial v_{\textrm{e}y}}{\partial t} B_o &= -&\dfrac{q}{m_e}\dfrac{\partial E_x}{\partial t} + \big( \dfrac{q B_o}{m_e} \big )^2 v_{\textrm{e}x}; \\
    \dfrac{\partial^2 v_{\textrm{ix}}}{\partial t^2} &= &\dfrac{q}{m_i}\dfrac{\partial E_x}{\partial t} + \dfrac{q}{m_i}\dfrac{\partial v_{\textrm{i}y}}{\partial t} B_o &= &\dfrac{q}{m_i}\dfrac{\partial E_x}{\partial t} + \big( \dfrac{q B_o}{m_i} \big )^2 v_{\textrm{i}x}.
\end{alignedat}

\section{From waves to electrons}

Let's talk about the aurora then. Even during geomagnetically quiet times,
roughly 20~GW\footnote{``How much is that?'' The average rate of energy
  consumption per household in the United States is $\sim$1.4~kW (as of 2014,
  according to the World Energy Council's ``Average electricity consumption per
  electrified household''). So 20~GW is enough to power roughly
  $\sim$\numprint{14000} homes in the United States. (For a more conservative
  rate of consumption, such as that in New Zealand---0.84~kW---20~GW could cover
  almost \numprint{24000} homes.)} \citep{Newell2009} are raining down on the
poles\footnote{Magnetic, not geographic.} of the earth through various types of
aurora, and so-called ``wave aurora''\footnote{Because, you know, it's powered
  by waves like---that's right, inertial \Alf waves!} contributes about 5\% of
the total energy budget. When things really start moving---for example, during a
geomagnetic storm---the electron precipitation associated with \Alf waves
increases quite a bit, and broadband electron energy and number flux can become
sizable fractions of the electron precipitation budget.

\subsection{You mean ``broadband'' like DSL?}

But just what are broadband electrons, and what do they have to do
with \Alf waves? The name refers to the tell-tale signature they leave
when we plot their differential energy flux---a nasty-sounding term, I
know.

Here's a sketch: Pick up a piece of paper. Imagine that during the
course of one second, an electron comes zipping through it. We'll use
this to define a unit \emph{number flux}, or \emph {1 electron per
  sheet of paper per second}--we'll call them \emph{epps}. So if over
the course of two seconds we counted ten electrons come through the
page, we'd say the average number flux during those two seconds was 5
epps. Fair enough?  Now, if instead of \emph{how many electrons pass
  through} the sheet of paper in a second (number flux), we wanted to
know \emph{how much energy the electrons carry through} the sheet of
paper in a second (energy flux), we'd have to count differently by
also asking every individual electron how much energy it has (that is,
how fast it's going)\footnote{The relationship between kinetic
  energy---the energy due to motion---and speed is bread and butter
  for classical (but not quantum) physicists: $E = \frac{1}{2}m v^2.$}
and then summing up the energy contribution of all the electrons
passing through the page within a second.

Last of all, suppose we wanted to know not just the \emph{total} electron energy
flux through the page, but the \emph{contribution} made by electrons
\emph{within some energy range} to the total energy flux.\footnote{What's the
  use, or utility, in sorting the electrons by energy? This information can tell
  us a lot about what is driving, or accelerating the electrons. In a word, it's
  knowing the difference between one bowling ball coming toward you at 100~mph
  versus 100 bowling balls coming toward you at 1~mph. Rather distinct
  scenarios, don't you think?} Here's an idea: You could slap an energy filter
on the page---never mind where we got this little device, just imagine---so that
we only count electrons with energies between, say, 100~eV and
200~eV.\footnote{``An `eV'?''  you say? One eV is one electron-volt---which is
  to say, it's the amount of energy that an electron has after being accelerated
  through a one-volt potential difference.} If we added up all the energy
carried by \emph{those} electrons, repeated the process for electrons having
energies of 200--500~eV, then 500--1200~eV, so on and so forth, we'd have a list
of electron energy ranges, and an energy flux measurement for each energy range,
\emph{capisce}? Like this:
\begin{equation}
  \label{ch1:eqeFlux}
  J_{E} = J_{E,\textrm{100--200 eV}} + J_{E,\textrm{200--500 eV}} + J_{E,\textrm{500--1200 eV}} + \dots .
\end{equation}
$J_E$ is the total energy flux.

Unfortunately even this description of energy flux isn't enough to
convey the meaning of \emph{differential energy flux}, which is what I
originally mentioned,\footnote{The ``deets,'' as I understand young
  people call them now, can be found in a killer introduction to the
  subject located in Appendix~E of the review by
  \citet{Bruno2013}. You could also check out some staples (for me,
  anyway) like Chapter~5 in \citet{Paschmann1998}.} but keep the
description and the following discussion in mind, because it's close
enough for you to be able to appreciate what I'm referring to in later
chapters when I bring up broadband electrons.

    ``pitch-angle spectrogram,'' and the lower panel an ``energy
    spectrogram'' (see text).}
  \label{ch1:FigAlfElec}
\end{figure}

% ----------------

Speaking of which, back to broadband electrons. When we fly satellites
above the aurora and measure the differential energy flux of auroral
electrons, we often get a response that is typified by what you see in
Figure~\ref{ch1:FigAlfElec}. The plot in the upper panel shows what
snobby space plasma physicists call a ``pitch-angle spectrogram.''
See how the second line of the left-hand axis label says ``Angle
(Deg.)''?  The angle in question---the \emph{pitch angle}---is
measured relative to the direction that the Earth's magnetic field
points so that, for example, 0$^\circ$ is ``field-aligned'' and
90$^\circ$ is perpendicular to the geomagnetic field. See the obvious
horizontal black strip in the pitch-angle spectrogram? That's telling
you these puppies (if I may be permitted the expression) are coming in
hot.

Take a look at the $y$ axis to get a sense of the range of
angles. Right: they're all within about 30$^\circ$ of 0$^\circ$. They
are mostly field-aligned. And the way to make a pitch-angle
spectrogram is to pick a pitch angle (maybe you could start by looking
at 0$^\circ$, straight down the magnetic field line), sum the
``filtered'' electron energy fluxes to get $J_E$\footnote{This should
  really be $\frac{dJ_E}{dE}$, but I'm afraid the return on investment
  (of \emph{your} time, not mine!) is too low to bother explaining it
  here. I'm telling you, see what \citet{Bruno2013} have to
  say. They'll even tell you about those atrocious units you see on
  the right-hand side of the lower panel, ``eV/cm$^2$-s-sr-eV.''} (use
equation \ref{ch1:eqeFlux}), pick a new pitch angle and again
calculate $J_E$, so on and so forth until you've calculated $J_E$ at
each pitch angle. Now, repeat the entire process over and over again
at a regular time interval and \emph{plot those data.} Bam!
Pitch-angle spectrogram.

Let me back up for a second. By combining this business of pitch
angles with our discussion of ``filtered'' measurements of electron
energy flux, the way we did in the last paragraph, you are not far
from what we actually do with particle detectors on rockets and
satellites. The goal of these detectors is to measure \emph{how many
  particles} (electrons, in our case) at \emph{some pitch angle} and
over \emph{some range of energies}. If you had made these types of
calculations for the electrons hanging out at $\sim$2700~km on Feb~2,
1997 somewhere on the nightside of the earth, and had decided to turn
those calculations into spectrograms, you might get something like
Figure~\ref{ch1:FigAlfElec} depending on where exactly you were.

    the FAST satellite [adapted from Figure~4b in \citealp{Dombeck2013}].}
  \label{ch1:FigDombeck}
\end{figure}

% ----------------

The plot in the lower panel---a typical example of unimaginatively
named \emph{energy spectrograms}---shows that ``tell-tale signature''
of broadband electrons that I mentioned at the beginning of this
section. What is it saying? Look at the second line of the $y$ axis in
this case: ``Energy (eV).'' See how virtually all of the action in
this panel is below 1000~eV, and how the action is more or less
uniformly hot over energies from 4~eV up to wherever the differential
energy flux cuts off? Compare that with what you see in
Figure~\ref{ch1:FigDombeck}, and maybe now you can appreciate why the
former are called ``broadband.'' 

The way to make this plot is, instead of adding up the contribution to
differential energy flux from each \emph{energy range} to a given
\emph{pitch angle} , to add up the contribution to differential energy
flux from each \emph{pitch angle} to a given \emph{energy range}, and
\emph{average}. Therefore, one might say that each type of spectrogram
shown in Figure~\ref{ch1:FigAlfElec} is a different way of looking at
the same coin, and clearly each type of spectrogram conveys different
information about the local electrons.

You might be saying to yourself (and rightly so), ``What does that
have to do with \Alf waves? Nothing about Figure~\ref{ch1:FigAlfElec}
says 'jiggly magnetic field lines' or 'guitar string' to me. Wasn't
that the idea?'' Yes, young padowan. 

In the auroral zone---an altitude of a few hundred km and above at
latitudes\footnote{As before, I mean magnetic latitude and not
  geographic.}  above $\sim$60$^\circ$---field-aligned electrons
barrel toward the atmosphere and are near the top of the list of
causes of aurora. The complication is, as you can imagine, that there
are several ways one could get field-aligned
acceleration.\footnote{\citet{Wygant2002}, \citet{Bostrom2003a},
  \citet{Morooka2004}, \citet{Newell2009}, \citet{Hull2010},
  \citet{Mottez2016}, are only a handful among many, many current or
  recently retired researchers who would love to tell you more, and
  they aren't even the historical giants (like \citet{Knight1973},
  \citet{Evans1974}, \citet{Hasegawa1976}, and \citet{Lyons1980a}, to
  name a few) who laid the groundwork!}
\citet{Chaston2002,Chaston2003a,Chaston2007,Chaston2008} in particular
will tell you that \Alf waves are certainly on the short list of
culprits, and are in fact the cause of what we see in
Figure~\ref{ch1:FigAlfElec}, but how would they know?

Your ship has been prepared for ludicrous speed.\footnote{Dark Helmet,
  Spaceballs.} You now know twhat \Alf waves are, what inertial \Alf waves (or
IAWs) are, the icky math swamp they arise from, and what the signatures of
\Alfic electron acceleration are in pitch-angle and energy spectrograms. 

``I mean, yeah! That was an extremely engaging introduction to the topic,
Spencer. You really know your stuff.'' Ha! I appreciate the compliment, and
you'll see in succeeding chapters that it is unsubstantiated: Many, many
questions remain around the role of ionospheric IAWs in dynamic
coupling\footnote{\textit{Dynamic coupling}: Space-physics speak for those periods of
  time when the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is too rapid to ignore the
  scary math that we normally try to avoid because it's complicated, but on the
  other hand is capable of describing ``dynamic'' effects. To cite a concrete
  example or two, I mention studies like those by \citet{Mishin2015} or
  \citet{Verkhoglyadova2016}, who investigate definite instances when dynamic
  (or sometimes ``inductive'') effects can't be ignored.} in thermospheric
heating, in the exact processes by which large-scale waves become small-scale,
and the like. In fact, let me give you a rundown on each of the succeeding
chapters so you can appreciate what questions my advisers, mentors, and
colleagues and I have been researching and why.

\subsection{(Barn)stormed ionosphere: IAWs!!!}

% \section{``And your aim, Mr. Hatch?'' }

\subsection{Next }


By now we are both tired of mudslogging, and we're just in time to turn around
and get the lay of the land: let me tell you what the rest of this thesis is
about. Reading the following summary will be your first exercise in synthesizing
all the new concepts you just picked up! There will be a handshake waiting for
you on the other side of this section.

The magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) transition region is the several
thousand--kilometer stretch between the cold, dense and variably resistive
region of ionized atmospheric gases that begins some tens of kilometers above
the terrestrial surface, and the hot, tenuous, and highly conductive plasmas
that interface with the solar wind at higher altitudes. The M-I transition
region is therefore the site through which magnetospheric conditions, which are
strongly susceptible to dynamics in the solar wind, are communicated to
ionospheric plasmas, and vice versa.

We systematically study the influence of solar wind conditions and geomagnetic
storms on energy input and particle precipitation in the M-I transition region,
emphasizing the role of inertial \Alf waves both as a preferred mechanism for
dynamic (as opposed to static) energy transfer and particle acceleration between
the magnetosphere and the ionosphere, and as a low-altitude manifestation of
high-altitude dynamic interaction between the solar wind and the
magnetosphere. We examine the influence of inertial \Alf waves via the
electromagnetic and electron energy deposition, electron precipitation, and ion
outflow coincident with these waves as observed by the Fast Auroral SnapshoT
Explorer (FAST) satellite.  

We investigate the effect of storms on these measures via a superposed epoch
analysis, and find that dayside and nightside occurrences rates of \Alf waves,
as well as the concomitant rates of energy deposition, electron precipitation,
and ion upflow, rapidly and dramatically increase at storm sudden
commencement. We also derive high-latitude distributions of these measures as a
function of storm phase, showing that storm main and recovery phase correspond
to strong variation in each signature of \Alfic activity, particularly on the
dayside at and in the vicinity of the cusp as well as premidnight.  

From calculation of global rates of \Alfic energy deposition, electron
precipitation, and ion outflow in each hemisphere, we explicitly demonstrate
that storm main and recovery phases together account for more than 65\% of
global \Alfic energy deposition and electron precipitation, and more than 70\%
of the coincident ion outflow, even though the combined occurrence rate of storm
main and recovery phase is statistically only 33\%.  We also carry out an
investigation of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) control of inertial \Alf
wave activity in the M-I transition region.

Our investigation takes the form of an observational test of the
Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry global MHD simulations conducted by \textsl{Zhang et al.}
[2014], which predict that southward IMF conditions lead to enhanced generation
of power in the magnetotail that is then manifest as bursty bulk flows and
\Alfic power on the nightside. We confirm this prediction, as well as the
simulation prediction that in the Northern Hemisphere, dayside \Alfic power is
preferentially enhanced in the prenoon sector under predominantly duskward IMF
conditions. The observed and predicted prenoon enhancement in \Alfic power
stands in contrast with the established response [e.g., \textsl{Zhou et al.},
2000] to duskward IMF exhibited by direct-entry precipitation, which becomes
enhanced in the postnoon sector. This situation reverses under dawnward IMF
conditions. Though the effect is present in both simulation and observation, the
mechanism for dayside generation of \Alfic power remains unclear.  

We then compare \Alfic Poynting flux distributions under several IMF orientation
to corresponding distributions of broadband precipitation, identified as such
using a version of the \textsl{Newell et al.}  [2009] scheme for categorizing
electron precipitation adapted for FAST instrumentation. We incidentally find
that $\approx$95\% of cusp-region inertial \Alf wave events are associated with
precipitation that is categorized by the \textsl{Newell et al.} [2009] scheme as
diffuse, purely on the basis of the criterion imposed on minimum average energy
($E_{av} \geq$~300~eV) for cusp-region broadband precipitation. This suggests
that the prevailing definition of diffuse precipitation, as it applies to the
cusp region, needs further qualification.

Last, we present FAST observations on the nightside of discrete, field-aligned
precipitation with corresponding differential number flux spectra that are much
better described by a kappa distribution than by a Maxwellian distribution. With
only a few exceptions in the literature discrete precipitation has been
theoretically treated and modeled as with Maxwellian distributions, while the
spectral shapes of discrete precipitation that we present have often been viewed
as a feature of diffuse precipitation. Guided by theoretical work performed by
\textsl{Dors and Kletzing} [1999], we examine the implications of these
observations for the commonly used Knight Relation.

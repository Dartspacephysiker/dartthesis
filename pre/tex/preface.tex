A salute and a nod to Micah, who introduced the necessary seed of
doubt, as a sower of tares, that graduate school ``is academic
hazing.''  Though sight was lacking aforetime, I now see, true
yokefellow.

I once was witness to the granting of immortality with a single stroke
of breath, a \textsl{sospiro}, produced by David McGaw as we stood
contemplating the meaning of attention deficit disorder: ``I don't
have a problem paying attention; I'm keeping track of a million things
at once!''  Talk about a power statement! With the suddenness of a
thunderbolt's stroke I ascended from slight disadvantage relative to
my peers to superiority, no less than \emph{one million times over!}
It has been a self-muttered refrain and consolation, and thanks are
duly accorded.

To use that insipid turn of phrase, I would be remiss if I failed to
likewise accord thanks to a SWAT team appointed by the fates and bent
on seeing that I survive Dartmouth. These are primarily the angelic
(no hyperbole) Lauren Costa, my dear and faithful (though he may not
reciprocate these adjectives) friend, Yipeng Shi, and another of the
[Art Blakey's Jazz] Messengers, Ayobami Olufadeji. I am happy at the
thought of each of you. Why have you put up with me? Thank you.

But to whom is reserved the dedication? Above all, in every good
sense, \emph{to the One who is fairer and purer than both meadow and
  woodland,} through whom I shall never want.

{\Huge \bf Preface} \\

``I bet you've never heard a conversation like this before.'' That's
where you're right. I haven't---as the pauper's mite before the
throne, or as the grass blade's glory at the door of the
% oven. And what bearing, so trite a subject in the face of so grave a
oven. And what bearing, such trifling in the face of so grave a
matter?  The years tell.  One before remarked (and we marked well, or
else did well to mark) that a great ship is turned by a very small
helm. Doubtless---though somehow not comprehended, world without
end. They will not have forgotten the words of Comte Anatole de
Montesquiou-F\'{e}zensac:

\begin{quote} 
\begin{spacing}{1.1}
Comme ils sont provocants! Comme ils sont fiers toujours! \\
Comme on ose r\'{e}gner sur nos sorts et nos jours! \\
\\
% \^{O} la mortelle injure! La cadence est moins lente! \\
% Et la chute plus s\^{u}re! Nous rabattrons bien leur caquets! \\
% Nous serons bient\^{o}t leurs laquais! \\
% Qu'ils sont laids! Chers minois! \\ 
% Qu'ils sont fols! (Airs coquets!) \\
% \\
\dots \\
\\
Adieu donc et bons jours aux tyrans de nos coeurs! \\
\end{spacing}
\end{quote}
Which shall be had of another's hand; we lie down in sorrow.

So while it is called, Today: it is heightless and depthless, this hope.

{\Huge \bf Acknowledgments} \\

I once was witness to the granting of literary immortality with a
single stroke of breath, produced by David McGaw as we contemplated
the meaning of attention deficit disorder: ``I don't have ADD; I'm
keeping track of a million things at once!'' Talk about a power
statement! As if by lightning I went from slight disadvantage relative
to my peers to superiority, no less than \emph{one million times
  over!} It has been my self-spoken refrain and consolation, and due
thanks are accorded.

To use that insipid turn of phrase, I would be remiss if I failed to
likewise accord thanks to a SWAT team appointed by the fates and bent
on my survival of Dartmouth. These are primarily the angelic (no
hyperbole) Lauren Costa, my dear and faithful (though he may not
reciprocate these adjectives) friend, Yipeng Shi, and another of the [Art
Blakey's Jazz] Messengers, Ayobami Olufadeji. I am happy at the
thought of any of you. Why did you put up with me? Thank you.


And above all, in every good sense, \emph{to the One who is fairer and
  purer than both meadow and woodland,} through whom I expect no want.

{\Huge \bf Preface} \\

``I bet you've never heard a conversation like this before.'' That's
where you're right. I haven't---as the pauper's mite before the
throne, or as the grass blade's glory at the door of the
% oven. And what bearing, so trite a subject in the face of so grave a
oven. And what bearing, such trifling in the face of so grave a
matter?  The years tell.  One before remarked (and we marked well, or
else did well to mark) that a great ship is turned by a very small
helm. Doubtless---though somehow not comprehended, world without
end. They will not have forgotten the words of Comte Anatole de
Montesquiou-F\'{e}zensac:

\begin{quote} 
\begin{spacing}{1.1}
Comme ils sont provocants! Comme ils sont fiers toujours! \\
Comme on ose r\'{e}gner sur nos sorts et nos jours! \\
\\
% \^{O} la mortelle injure! La cadence est moins lente! \\
% Et la chute plus s\^{u}re! Nous rabattrons bien leur caquets! \\
% Nous serons bient\^{o}t leurs laquais! \\
% Qu'ils sont laids! Chers minois! \\ 
% Qu'ils sont fols! (Airs coquets!) \\
% \\
\dots \\
\\
Adieu donc et bons jours aux tyrans de nos coeurs! \\
\end{spacing}
\end{quote}
Which shall be had of another's hand; we lie down in sorrow.

So while it is called, Today: it is heightless and depthless, this hope.

This chapter is the version of the manuscript ``IMF control of \Alfic energy
transport and deposition at high latitudes'' that has been submitted for
publication to \textsl{Journal of Geophysical Research--Space Physics}, and is
awaiting peer review.

The contributions of each author are as follows:

\textbf{S. M. Hatch} wrote the literature review; conceived and described the
conditions constituting ``stable'' IMF conditions within the scope of the study;
performed all analysis and produced all plots that original to the study;
conceived the idea to extend the partial application of the \textsl{Newell et
  al.} [2009] algorithm, as described in \hyperref{chp:1}{Chapter~1}, to the
entire FAST data set; and following W. Lotko's suggestion to overlay broadband
precipitation derived from LFM simulations (though ultimately observed broadband
precipitation was used) with observed Poynting flux, discovered and presented
the discrepancy between broadband electron precipitation and Alfv\'{e}n
wave--associated electron precipitation detailed in this study.

\textbf{J. LaBelle} conceived, together with W. Lotko c. 2012, the idea to
perform complementary theoretical and observational studies of IMF control of
high-latitude, and more particularly cusp-region, \Alf waves; in the early phase
(c. 2013--14) organized meetings with W.~Lotko and B.~Zhang to discuss
discrepancies between LFM simulations, other observations, and early versions of
the \Alf wave database.

\textbf{W. Lotko} provided discussion, feedback, and theoretical insight over
the course of years on this study, and particularly spent hours explaining
previously published methodologies and discussing them with S.M. Hatch; gave
detailed feedback on several revisions of the manuscript; and conceived the
direct comparison between broadband precipitation and Alf\'{e}nic Poynting flux
in the Discussion of this study.

\textbf{C. C. Chaston} provided substantial feedback on the abstract,
discussion, and key points of the paper; suggested the means by which the
discrepancy between rates of broadband precipitation as defined by
\textsl{Newell et al.}~[2009] and rates of Alfv\'{e}n wave--associated electron
precipitation could be resolved (i.e., modification of the definition of
broadband precipitation to include pitch-angle information); suggested the
ultimate title of the study; and by expressing discomfort with the lack of a
proposed mechanism for dayside generation of \Alfic power in the text, provided
S.M. Hatch the impetus that led to the review of traveling convection vortices
in the Discussion.

\textbf{B. Zhang}, along with W. Lotko, was present for cumulatively many hours
of discussion over the course of years on the topic of this study, and provided
commentary and feedback on drafts of the manuscript.

abstract = {Measurements from the Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS) and Magnetometer (MAG) on the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging spacecraft during 40 orbits about Mercury are used to characterize the plasma depletion layer just exterior to the planet's dayside magnetopause. A plasma depletion layer forms at Mercury as a result of piled-up magnetic flux that is draped around the magnetosphere. The low average upstream Alfv{\'{e}}nic Mach number (MA {\~{}}3â€“5) in the solar wind at Mercury often results in large-scale plasma depletion in the magnetosheath between the subsolar magnetopause and the bow shock. Flux pileup is observed to occur downstream under both quasi-perpendicular and quasi-parallel shock geometries for all orientations of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Furthermore, little to no plasma depletion is seen during some periods with stable northward IMF. The consistently low value of plasma $\beta$, the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure, at the magnetopause associated with the low average upstream MA is believed to be the cause for the high average reconnection rate at Mercury, reported to be nearly 3 times that observed at Earth. Finally, a characteristic depletion length outward from the subsolar magnetopause of {\~{}}300 km is found for Mercury. This value scales among planetary bodies as the average standoff distance of the magnetopause.},

abstract = {Instrumentation that detects individual plasma particles is susceptible to random counting errors. These errors propagate into the calculations of moments of measured particle velocity distribution functions. Although rules of thumb exist for the effects of random errors on the calculation of lower order moments (e.g., density, velocity, and temperature) of Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, they do not generally apply to nonthermal distributions or to higher-order moments. To date, such errors have only been estimated using brute force Monte Carlo techniques, i.e., repeated ({\~{}}50) samplings of distribution functions. Here we present a mathematical formalism for analytically obtaining uncertainty estimates of plasma moments due to random errors either measured in situ by instruments or synthesized by particle simulations. Our uncertainty estimates precisely match the statistical variation of simulated plasma moments and carry the computational cost equivalent of only {\~{}}15 Monte Carlo samplings. In addition, we provide the means to calculate a covariance matrix that can be reported along with typical plasma moments. This matrix enables the propagation of statistical errors into arbitrary coordinate systems or functions of plasma moments without the need to reanalyze full distribution functions. Our methodology, which is applied to electron data from Plasma Electron and Current Experiment on the Cluster spacecraft as an example, is relevant to both existing and future data sets and requires only instrument-measured counts and phase space densities reported for a set of calibrated energy-angle targets.},

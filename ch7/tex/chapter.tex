  \section{Le denouement}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  The contributions of this thesis include, but are not limited to

  Several studies could profitably be undertaken. 

  The questions left open by the study of the \Alfic response in the
  M-I transition region to geomagnetic storms detailed in
  Chapter~\ref{chp:1} are many. A natural follow-up study would
  broaden the results shown in Figure~5 of Chapter~\ref{chp:1} to show
  the dependence of all types of auroral precipitation on storm phase,
  and loosen the restrictions on monoenergetic precipitation
  prescribed by \citet{McIntosh2014} by sorting monoenergetic
  precipitation based on its description as, e.g., ``highly
  nonthermal'' ($\kappa <$~1.7), ``nonthermal'' (1.7 $\leq \kappa
  <$~2.5), ``near-equilibrium'' (2.5 $\leq \kappa <$~5),
  ``quasi-Maxwellian'' (5~$\leq \kappa <$~10), and ``Maxwellian''
  ($\kappa \geq$~10).

  In Chapter~\ref{chp:4} the manner in which $\phi_{\textrm{IMF}}$
  orientation statistically controls Alfv\'{e}nic energy deposition
  leaves open two questions that appear to be presently within the realm
  of resolvability.

  The first has to do with the mechanism for dayside generation of
  \Alfic power. Observations and simulation exist at virtually every
  altitude between ground level and the magnetopause, but it remains
  to be conclusively demonstrated, or else refuted, that
  Kelvin-Helmholtz waves are the source for the observed motion of
  what has here been termed the ``\Alfic cusp,'' or the site of
  enhanced \Alfic electromagnetic and electron energy deposition as
  well as enhanced broadband precipitation. Dedicated, high-resolution
  simulation runs involving realistic solar wind inputs during periods
  of predominantly duskward IMF, which corresponds to Northern
  Hemisphere prenoon \Alfic enhancements, and vice versa under
  dawnward IMF, could potentially determine the relationship between
  net Alfv\'{e}nic power generated on the dayside and IMF $B_y$
  magnitude. To my knowledge no study has attempted to quantify this
  relationship, though citet{Zhang2014} have commented that LFM
  simulations indicate that it is nonlinear.

  The second would constitute resolution of the issue presented in
  Chapter~\ref{chp:4} dealing with the discrepancy between electrons
  observed in association with IAWs and the MLT-dependent definition
  of broadband precipitation given by \citet{Newell2009}, which
  requires that at least one ESA channel above 300~eV exhibit dJE/dE >
  2.0~$\times$~10$^8$~eV/(cm$^2$~s~sr~eV) within 9.5--14.5~MLT;
  outside this MLT range the threshold energy is 140~eV. This would be
  accomplished by incorporating pitch-angle information into the
  definition of broadband electron precipitation, and would result in
  a more accurate definition of broadband precipitation, or perhaps
  even definition of additional types of precipitation.

  If this study were carried out prior to execution of the storm
  phase--dependent study of the precipitation types defined by
  \citet{Newell2009}that was mentioned above, it would then be
  possible to quantify the degree of discrepancy between electron
  energy deposition and precipitation categorized under the original
  \citet{Newell2009} definitions and under updated definitions of
  broadband and diffuse precipitation are discrepant.

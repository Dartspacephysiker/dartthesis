  The contributions of this thesis include, but are not limited to

  Several studies could profitably be undertaken. 

  The questions left open by the study of the \Alfic response in the
  M-I transition region to geomagnetic storms detailed in
  \hyperref{chp:1}{Chapter~1} are many. A natural follow-up study
  would broaden the results shown in Figure~5 of
  \hyperref{chp:1}{Chapter~1} to show the dependence of all types of
  auroral precipitation on storm phase, and loosen the restrictions on
  monoenergetic precipitation prescribed by \citet{McIntosh2014} by
  sorting monoenergetic precipitation based on its description as,
  e.g., ``highly nonthermal'' ($\kappa <$~1.7), ``nonthermal'' (1.7
  $\leq \kappa <$~2.5), ``near-equilibrium'' (2.5 $\leq \kappa <$~5),
  ``quasi-Maxwellian'' (5~$\leq \kappa <$~10), and ``Maxwellian''
  ($\kappa \geq$~10). This study would also address the basic question
  left unanswered by the study in \hyperref{chp:6}{Chapter~6} on
  whether there exists a connection between geomagnetic conditions and
  production of extremely nonthermal precipitation.

  In \hyperref{chp:4}{Chapter~4} the manner in which $\phi_{\textrm{IMF}}$
  orientation statistically controls Alfv\'{e}nic energy deposition
  leaves open two questions that appear to be within the realm of
  immediate resolvability.

  The first has to do with the mechanism for dayside generation of
  \Alfic power. Observations and simulation exist at virtually every
  altitude between ground level and the magnetopause, but it remains
  to be conclusively demonstrated, or else refuted, that
  Kelvin-Helmholtz waves are the source for the observed motion of
  what has here been termed the ``\Alfic cusp,'' or the site of
  enhanced \Alfic electromagnetic and electron energy deposition as
  well as enhanced broadband precipitation. Dedicated, high-resolution
  simulation runs involving realistic solar wind inputs during periods
  of predominantly duskward IMF, which corresponds to Northern
  Hemisphere prenoon \Alfic enhancements, and vice versa under
  dawnward IMF, could potentially determine the relationship between
  net Alfv\'{e}nic power generated on the dayside and IMF $B_y$
  magnitude. To my knowledge no study has attempted to quantify this
  relationship, though \citet{Zhang2014} have indicated that LFM
  simulations suggest that it is nonlinear.

  The second would constitute resolution of the issue that arose in
  \hyperref{chp:4}{Chapter~4} dealing with the discrepancy between
  electrons observed in association with IAWs and the MLT-dependent
  definition of broadband precipitation given by \citet{Newell2009},
  which requires that at least one ESA channel above 300~eV exhibit
  dJE/dE > 2.0~$\times$~10$^8$~eV/(cm$^2$~s~sr~eV) within
  9.5--14.5~MLT; outside this MLT range the threshold energy is
  140~eV. This would be accomplished by incorporating pitch-angle
  information into the definition of broadband electron precipitation,
  and would result in a more accurate definition of broadband
  precipitation, or perhaps even definition of additional types of
  precipitation.

  If this study were carried out prior to execution of the storm
  phase--dependent study of the precipitation types defined by
  \citet{Newell2009}that was mentioned above, it would then be
  possible to quantify the degree of discrepancy between electron
  energy deposition and precipitation categorized under the original
  \citet{Newell2009} definitions and under updated definitions of
  broadband and diffuse precipitation are discrepant.

  Finally, the results of application of the \citet{Bellan2016} method
  for calculation of low-frequency wave vectors, presented in
  \hyperref{chp:5}{Chapter~5}, needs to be compared with results of the other,
  more established methods (e.g., interferometry) for wave vector
  calculation. Provided that an appropriate interval can be identified
  in the FAST data set the suite of instruments aboard FAST will allow
  for this comparison, and by combining results from each method, may
  allow for calculation of the full wave vector. To my knowledge this
  has never been done with FAST observations, and would not be
  possible without the ability afforded by the \citet{Bellan2016}
  method to resolve wave vector components using magnetic field and
  particle measurements.
  
  Evidence is given in \hyperref{chp:5}{Chapter~5} that it is possible
  to derive the perpendicular components of the wave vector associated
  with inertial \Alf waves using FAST measurements. With the addition
  of the parallel component of the wave vector, estimated via E-field
  interferometry, the manner in which inertial \Alf waves propagate
  relative to large-scale ionospheric convection could conceivably be
  addressed.

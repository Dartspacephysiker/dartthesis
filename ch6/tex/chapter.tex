  \section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  The development of quasi-steady potential differences along the
  high-latitude geomagnetic field lines connecting the plasma sheet
  and high-latitude magnetosphere to the ionosphere is a basic
  consequence of ongoing convection of geomagnetic field lines
  populated with both solar wind and terrestrial plasma. Without
  assigning a mechanism, \citet{Knight1973} formally demonstrated the
  relationship between a field-aligned, monotonic potential profile
  characterized by a total potential difference $\Delta \Phi$ and the
  the corresponding field-aligned current density at the ionosphere
  $j_{\parallel,i}$ generated by precipitation of magnetospheric
  particles subject to a magnetic mirror ratio $R_B = B_{i} /
  B_{m}$,
  % \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation} \label{ch6:eqKnight} j_{\parallel,i} ( \, \Delta \Phi ;
      T_m, n_m, R_B ) = - e n_m \Big ( \frac{k_B T_m}{2 \pi m_e} \Big
      )^{\frac{1}{2}} R_B \Bigg [ 1 - \Big ( 1 - R_B^{-1} \Big )
      \textrm{exp} \Big \{ - \frac{e \Delta \Phi}{k_B T_m ( R_B - 1 )}
      \Big \} \Bigg],
    \end{equation}
  % \end{linenomath*}
  where $T_m$ and $n_m$ are respectively the temperature and density
  of precipitating electrons at the magnetospheric source.

  % From Boström [2003]:
  % Observations of auroral electron, and ionospheric ion, acceleration
  % [e.g., Reiffetal., 1988; Lundin and Eliasson, 1991, and references
  % therein], electric fields [Mozer and Hull, 2001] and the AKR source
  % region [e.g., Bahnsen et al., 1989] suggest that the acceleration
  % occurs at altitudes of 1–2 RE which corresponds to z = 8–30 (for
  % flux tubes with the ionospheric end at a magnetic latitude of 70? or
  % more) although a strict limit to the acceleration region may be
  % difficult to establish experimentally

  Equation (\ref{ch6:eqKnight}), otherwise known as the J-V or Knight
  relation, elucidates the role of field-aligned potential differences
  within the large-scale current system connecting the magnetosphere
  and the ionosphere that was posited by Kristian Birkeland more than
  a century ago, and represents a nexus in both the historical and
  theoretical developments that have led to present understanding of
  the magnetosphere-ionosphere current system
  \citep[e.g.,][]{Temerin1997,Hultqvist1999,Cowley2000,Bostrom2003a,Paschmann2003,Pierrard2007a,Karlsson2012}.

  The Knight relation assumes that the magnetospheric source
  population is in thermal equilibrium and is thus described by the
  Maxwellian distribution
  % \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation} \label{ch6:eqMax1D} f_{M}( E ; T, n) \, = n \Big (
      \frac{m}{2 \pi k_{B} T} \Big )^{\frac{3}{2}} \textrm{exp} \Big (
      - E / k_B T \Big ).
    \end{equation}
  % \end{linenomath*}
  The spectral shape of this distribution is governed by the
  parameters $T$ and $n$, and neglects the suprathermal tails of
  magnetospheric electron and ion source populations that have often
  been observed by in situ spacecraft. The first such reports appeared
  almost three decades ago \citep{Christon1989,Christon1991}
  followed by reports at low altitudes (<~1000~km) and in the
  high-latitude plasma sheet \citep{Wing1998,Kletzing2003}.

  Despite more frequent association at ionospheric altitudes with
  diffuse, or unaccelerated, precipitation \citep[see, e.g.,
  ][]{Newell2009,McIntosh2014} than with accelerated precipitation,
  the possibility of a source distribution with a ``high energy tail''
  was in fact acknowledged by \citet{Knight1973}, and reformulations
  of (\ref{ch6:eqKnight}) assuming a variety of alternative source
  distributions have since been developed
  \citep{Pierrard1996,Dors1999,Bostrom2003a,Bostrom2004}.

  One such alternative distribution employed with increasing frequency
  is the kappa distribution (\citet{Livadiotis2013}, Equation 3.22)
  % \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation} \label{ch6:eqKappa1D} f_{\kappa}(E; T, n, \kappa) = n
      \Bigg ( \frac{m}{2 \pi (\kappa - \frac{3}{2}) k_{B} T \, } \Bigg
      )^{- \frac{3}{2}} \frac{\Gamma \big ( \kappa + 1 \big ) }{\Gamma
        \big ( \kappa - \frac{1}{2} \big ) } \Bigg ( 1 + \frac{E}{
        \big ( \kappa - \frac{3}{2} \big ) k_B T } \Bigg )^{-1 -
        \kappa},
 \end{equation}
 % \end{linenomath*}
 which originally entered the space physics community as a model for
 observed high-energy tails in the solar wind
 \citep{Vasyliunas1968}. Relaxing the assumption of a magnetospheric
 source population in thermal equilibrium, \citet{Dors1999} showed
 that the J-V relation (\ref{ch6:eqKnight}) becomes
  % \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation} \label{ch6:eqDors} j_{\parallel,i} ( \, \Delta \Phi ;
      T_m, n_m, \kappa, R_B ) = - e n_m \sqrt{ \frac{k_B T_m (\kappa -
          \frac{3}{2})}{2 \pi m_e \kappa^{\frac{3}{2}}}} \frac{\Gamma
        (\kappa + 1)}{\Gamma (\kappa - \frac{1}{2})} \frac{R_B}{
        (\kappa - 1)} \Bigg[1- \Big(1-R_B^{-1} \Big) \Bigg(1+\frac{e
        \Delta \Phi}{ k_B T_m (\kappa - \frac{3}{2})(R_B - 1)}
      \Bigg)^{1-\kappa} \Bigg].
 \end{equation}
 % \end{linenomath*}

 The additional parameter $\kappa \in [ \, 3/2, \infty )$ in
 (\ref{ch6:eqKappa1D}) and (\ref{ch6:eqDors}) parameterizes the degree
 to which particle motion is correlated, and is therefore related to
 the ``thermodynamic distance'' between a given stationary,
 non-equilibrium state and thermal equilibrium. The theoretical
 minimum (in three dimensions) $\kappa_{\textrm{min}} = 3/2$
 corresponds to perfectly correlated motion of particles while $\kappa
 \rightarrow \infty$ corresponds to uncorrelated motion of particles,
 or thermal equilibrium
 \citep{Livadiotis2010,Livadiotis2011,Livadiotis2013}. The review by
 \citet{Livadiotis2010} shows both theoretical and observational
 evidence suggesting that $\kappa_t \simeq 2.45$ marks a transition
 between stationary states that are far from thermal equilibrium,
 $\kappa \in [ \, 3/2, \kappa_T )$, and near-equilibrium states for
 which $\kappa \in [ \, \kappa_T, \infty )$. If all other parameters
 are held fixed, $\kappa \simeq 1.63$ yields the minimum-entropy kappa
 distribution.

 Regarding physical origins, a host of mechanisms leading to
 production of a suprathermal tail exist \citep[e.g., review
 by][]{Pierrard2010}, many of which are instances of the general
 process by which superdiffusivity arises in a geometrically
 constrained, crowded driven physical system \citep{Benichou2013}.
 The correlated particle motion accompanying non-equilibrium
 stationarity also arises in processes exhibiting self-similar, or
 fractal, scales; hence its connection with turbulent and
 scale-invariant processes \citep{West1990,Treumann1999a,Leubner2004}.

 In this Letter we reexamine previously reported FAST observations of
 precipitating monoenergetic electrons above the auroral ionosphere,
 and find instances of magnetospheric source populations in stationary
 states that are far from thermal equilibrium.

  \section{Observations and Distribution Modeling}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  Using 2-D model distributions based on either a 1-D Maxwellian
  distribution (\ref{ch6:eqMax1D}) or a 1-D kappa distribution
  (\ref{ch6:eqKappa1D}), we perform fits to the electron precipitation
  within the atmospheric loss cone as measured by FAST electrostatic
  analyzers (ESAs) \citep{Carlson2001}. Four adjustable parameters are
  used for the kappa distribution and three parameters for the
  Maxwellian distribution. The parameters common to each distribution
  are $E_b$, $T$, and $n$, and the fourth parameter $\kappa$ is used
  only in the kappa distribution. For some applications
  \citep[e.g.,][]{Sutherland2012} it may be useful to relate the
  kinetic temperature of the kappa distribution to a thermalized
  ``core temperature'' $T_c = T (1-3/2 \kappa)$. The distinction is
  not made in this Letter, however, since the kinetic and
  thermodynamic definitions of temperature are consistent for each
  type of distribution \citep{Livadiotis2010}.

  Several authors \citep{Maggs1981,Bingham1999,Bingham2000,Mutel2007} have
  modeled 2-D distributions with the general form
  % \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation} \label{ch6:eq2DMod} f_{2D}(\, E^*, \theta ; T, n,
      \kappa) \, = f_{1D}(\, E^*; T, n, \kappa) \, g(\, \theta),
    \end{equation}
  % \end{linenomath*}
    where $E^*$ and $\theta$ are respectively the (possibly modified)
    electron energy and pitch angle, $f_{1D}$ is either the 1-D
    Maxwellian distribution (\ref{ch6:eqMax1D}) or the 1-D kappa
    distribution (\ref{ch6:eqKappa1D}), and $g(\theta )$ is a function
    describing, for example, the effects of the mirror force or the
    maser instability on the source distribution. Each group of
    authors employing the 2-D model (\ref{ch6:eq2DMod}) prescribe
    various forms for $g(\theta)$.  An alternative strategy presented
    by \citet{Pritchett1999} involves reduction of observed 2-D
    distributions to one dimension via integration.

      uncertainties of an arbitrary plasma distribution function
      [\citealt{Gershman2015}; see Appendix~A].}

  In this Letter our focus is the portion of the source population
  within the atmospheric loss cone $\theta_{\textrm{lc}}$, which is
  often $\sim$30$^\circ$ near FAST apogee at 4100~km. We therefore use
  $g(\theta) =$~1 in (\ref{ch6:eq2DMod}) and assume the electron
  energy $E$ is offset by a field-aligned potential drop $\Delta
  \Phi$, or $E^* = \big( \sqrt{e \Delta \Phi} - \sqrt{E} \big)^2$.

  Our procedure for estimating the parameters of $f_{2D}$ in
  (\ref{ch6:eq2DMod}) from measured electron distributions is the
  following: first, a 1-D differential energy flux spectrum is
  calculated by averaging the differential energy flux at each energy
  over the range of angles within the precipitating loss cone, after
  which a 1-D fit of the average spectrum is performed. Parameters
  from the 1-D fit are then used as the initial estimate of the
  parameters used to perform a direct 2-D fit of the observed
  differential energy flux distribution over a range of energies and
  angles selected to avoid inclusion of secondaries and other
  background populations. The range of angles includes all within the
  atmospheric loss cone $\theta_{\textrm{lc}}$; the range of energies
  extends from two energy bins below that in which the peak energy
  flux is observed to the ESA energy limit at 30~keV. Throughout this
  Letter the reported fit parameters are those resulting from 2-D
  fits.

  During an approximately 60-s interval on Feb 1, 1997 that was
  originally reported by \citet{Elphic1998}, the FAST satellite
  observed inverted V electron precipitation (Figures~\ref{ch6:Fig1}a
  and \ref{ch6:Fig1}b) and intermittent upgoing ion beams (not shown)
  near midnight MLT during a period of low geomagnetic activity ($K_p
  =$~1$^-$).

  Performing 2-D fits of the electron distributions within the
  atmospheric loss cone shows that many of the distributions are
  highly nonthermal, with $\kappa \lesssim$~2.0
  (Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}c). Values of the reduced chi-squared
  statistic $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}} = \frac{\sum_i Y(x) -
    y_i(x)}{\mathrm{dof}}$ for 2-D fits with a kappa distribution are
  at times much smaller than corresponding $\chi^2_{\textrm{red}}$
  values for fits with a Maxwellian distribution
  (Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}c), most markedly during the period between
  red bars (09:26:54--09:27:05~UT) in Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1} when
  $\kappa$ is frequently near the theoretical minimum
  $\kappa_{\mathrm{min}} =$~3/2.

  As a representative example of electron observations during the
  period between bars in Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}, Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig2} shows a
  1-D slice and the full 2-D distribution observed at 09:27:00.94~UT.
  In Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}a the 1-D best-fit kappa and Maxwellian
  distributions are overlaid (blue dashed line and red dash-dotted line,
  respectively). The best-fit kappa distribution is seen to describe
  both the suprathermal tail and the narrow peak of the observed
  distribution, whereas the best-fit Maxwellian distribution fails to
  describe the suprathermal tail but is able to describe the narrow
  peak via a best-fit temperature that is low compared to the observed
  temperature (40~eV versus $\sim$600~eV).

  Typical ranges of electron densities and temperatures in the distant
  plasma sheet are respectively 0.01--0.5~cm$^{-3}$ and 400-900~eV
  \citep{Kletzing2003,Paschmann2003}. Figures~\ref{ch6:Fig1}e--f show that
  within the inverted V precipitation, the observed (black diamonds)
  and best-fit kappa distribution (blue \emph{x} symbols) densities
  and temperatures are within these typical ranges; best-fit
  Maxwellian densities are also within the corresponding typically
  observed range, but the range of best-fit Maxwellian temperatures is
  somewhat low (20--300~eV) compared to the corresponding typical
  range in the plasma sheet.

  To independently infer $\kappa$, or the degree to which the
  magnetospheric source population is in a nonthermal stationary
  state, we use equations (\ref{ch6:eqKnight}) and (\ref{ch6:eqDors}), to fit
  observed potential drops $\Delta \Phi$ and electron current
  densities $j_{\parallel,i}$ that have been mapped to 100~km. The
  necessary elements are a reliable set of measurements of
  $j_{\parallel,i}$ and $\Delta \Phi$ from which to form an observed
  J-V relation, which can then be compared with a predicted J-V
  relation, and parameters $P_m = \{ n_m, T_m, R_B, \kappa \, \}$,
  which represent the source population in the magnetosphere and are
  to be used as inputs in (\ref{ch6:eqKnight}) and (\ref{ch6:eqDors}). In lieu
  of in situ observations of $P_m$, we infer the value of these
  parameters on the basis of FAST measurements.

  % \end{enumerate}

  % As an alternative and independent means by which to infer whether
  % the magnetospheric source populations are in a nonthermal stationary
  % state, we fit (\ref{ch6:eqKnight}) and (\ref{ch6:eqDors}) to observed
  % electron current densities $j_{\parallel,i}$, where $i$ denotes
  % mapping to 100~km, and potential drops $\Delta \Phi$. The two necessary elements

  %   observation.

  % \end{enumerate}

  To form pairs of ($j_{\parallel,i}, \Delta \Phi$) observations
  suitable for comparing with theory, $j_\parallel$ is calculated from
  the observed distribution $f_O ( E, \theta )$ over the range of
  pitch angles within the precipitating atmospheric loss cone, $\vert
  \theta \vert < 30^\circ$, and over all energies exceeding 300~eV.
  $j_{\parallel,i}$ is then obtained by mapping $j_\parallel$ to
  100~km using International Geomagnetic Reference Field 11, and the
  corresponding total potential drop $\Delta \Phi = \bar{E}_e +
  \bar{E}_i$ (white dotted line, Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}b) is calculated,
  where $\bar{E}_e$ is the average source-cone electron energy and
  $\bar{E}_i$ is that of the upgoing ion beam, if present, and zero
  otherwise.

  In practice only a small number of observed J-V pairs $(
  j_{\parallel,i} , \Delta \Phi )$ are suitable for our purposes: both
  thermal and nonthermal J-V relations (eqs. \ref{ch6:eqKnight} and
  \ref{ch6:eqDors}) require a single set of magnetospheric source
  parameters $P_m$, which in turn requires identification of periods
  during which the observed $P_m$ are sufficiently steady to be
  meaningfully related to the putative source distribution. Perhaps
  not coincidentally the period shown in Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1} during
  which $\kappa \lesssim 2$, 09:26:54--09:27:05~UT, also delineates a
  period during which the observed density, temperature, and $\kappa$
  are relatively steady. Having identified an appropriate set of
  observations, we now describe our methodology for estimating the
  source parameters $P_m$.

  The extreme values of $\kappa$ (Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}c) together with
  the steady temperatures (Figures~\ref{ch6:Fig1}e) and densities
  (Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}f) during the marked period imply adiabatic
  field-aligned transport, i.e., $T_m$ and $\kappa$ are largely
  unmodified between the magnetospheric source region and FAST
  altitudes. The average observed temperature $\bar{T}_F$ during each
  period is therefore identified as the source temperature $T_m$, and
  is treated as a fixed parameter (i.e., $T_m$ is not allowed to vary).
  
  From the vantage point of the magnetosphere-ionosphere transition
  region, the two remaining parameters $n_m$ and $R_B$ are tied as a
  consequence of the mirror force and the frozen-in flux
  condition. Confident estimation of each parameter solely on the
  basis of the observations in Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1} presents the most
  serious challenge to this analysis. We assume the source density
  $n_m$ is a function of the total electron density at FAST $n_F$
  (excluding the range of anti-earthward angles within which the
  source population has already been depleted), the mirror ratio
  between FAST and the magnetospheric source $R_{B,F} =
  B_\textrm{FAST} / B_m$, and potential drop $\Delta \Phi$ via the
  relationship \citep{Ratner1976,Barbosa1977}

  where $\bar{\phi} = \Delta \Phi / k_B T $ and $\alpha_F = 1 /
  R_{B,F}$. Equation (\ref{ch6:eqBarbosa}) is a sigmoid function
  \citep[Figure 1b][]{Barbosa1977} that describes how the number
  density of a hot plasma beam moving adiabatically into a region of
  converging magnetic field lines is modified by field-line
  compression and the mirror force. Since $n_F$ is fixed by
  observation, (\ref{ch6:eqBarbosa}) may instead be viewed as specifying
  the relationship between $R_{B,F}$ and $n_m$. The final issue is
  estimation of $R_B$, or equivalently $R_{B,F}$.

  Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig3}a displays contours of $\chi^2_{\textrm{red}} (
  \kappa, R_B )$, where
  \begin{subequations}
    \begin{align} \chi^2_{\mathrm{red}} = \frac{\sum_i j_{\parallel,i} (\Delta \Phi) - j_{\textrm{pred}\parallel,i}(\Delta \Phi; P_m)}{\mathrm{dof}}; \\
      P_m = \Big \{ n_m ( \hat{n}_F, \bar{\phi} , \alpha_F ),
      \hat{T}_m, R_B, \kappa \, \Big \}. \label{paramFit}
    \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
  Parameters with hats in (\ref{paramFit}) are fixed, and
  $j_{\textrm{pred}\parallel,i} $ is predicted by equation
  (\ref{ch6:eqDors}). Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig3}a indicates that only two scenarios
  are plausible: one is that the source population is located at or
  beyond $\sim$4.7~$R_E$ and is extremely nonthermal ($\kappa \lesssim
  1.7$); the other is that acceleration takes place at altitudes below
  2~$R_E$. 

  The cause of the large gap in ($\kappa, R_B$) parameter space that
  separates these scenarios is bifold; both have to do with the
  linearity condition $\Delta \Phi / k_B T \ll R_B $. First, relative
  to the thermal J-V relation (\ref{ch6:eqKnight}), for $\kappa
  \lesssim 2.5$ the J-V relation (\ref{ch6:eqDors}) is greatly
  influenced by saturation effects, which arise as the linearity
  condition is violated. Second, for equal number density and
  temperature, the current density predicted by the J-V relation
  (\ref{ch6:eqDors}) with $\kappa \simeq 1.65$ is more than double the
  current density predicted by the thermal J-V relation
  (\ref{ch6:eqKnight}) at $\Delta \Phi / k_B T =$~10, for example.

  As a result, a highly nonthermal source population is plausible in
  Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig3}a in two cases: (1) The source population is
  distant (i.e., $R_B \gtrsim$~4.7~$R_E$) so that the source density
  is greatly reduced relative to the density observed at FAST, per
  equation (\ref{ch6:eqBarbosa}). The much higher current predicted by the
  nonthermal J-V relation for extremely nonthermal $\kappa$ values
  compensates for the reduced number density. (2) The source
  population is near (i.e., $<$~2.2~$R_E$) so that the much higher
  number density compensates for current saturation.

  The distinction that must be borne in mind is that, for the period
  09:26:54--09:27:05~UT, a highly nonthermal source is compatible with
  either a nearby or a distant source region. A source in thermal
  equilibrium is only compatible with a nearby source region.

  Both nonthermal and thermal sources are represented in
  Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig3}b, which shows the observed ($j_{\parallel,i},
  \Delta \Phi$) values (black plus signs) with vertical error bars
  calculated as described in Appendix~A, and best-fit nonthermal and
  thermal J-V relations given correspondingly by equation
  (\ref{ch6:eqKnight}) and equation (\ref{ch6:eqDors}) (blued dashed line and
  red dash-dotted line, respectively). The best-fit nonthermal J-V
  relation (or that for which $\chi^2_{\textrm{red}} ( \kappa, R_B )$
  is a global minimum) is given by $\kappa =$~1.58 and $R_B =$799. The
  best-fit thermal J-V relation ($\kappa \rightarrow \infty$) is given
  by $R_B =$~8.6 (red dash-dotted line).

  % As we show momentarily, under the assumption of a source population
  % in thermal equilibrium the predicted J-V relationship appears
  % incompatible with observational constraints on $R_B$.

  To observationally constrain $R_B$ we assume that acceleration of
  % the precipitating electron population takes place over a distance
  % along the field line that is negligible compared to the scale length over which con
  the precipitating electron population occurs prior to undergoing
  pitch-angle spreading due to the mirror force. The nearly isotropic
  appearance of 2-D distribution functions during the period of
  interest in Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}, of which Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig2}b is an
  example, seems to justify this assumption. On this point
  \citet{Bostrom2003a} has observed, ``If some preacceleration has
  taken place at much higher altitudes the mirror effect will make the
  distribution look more like an isotropically accelerated
  distribution.''

  With the foregoing assumption we define a ``thermal angle'' $\phi_T
  = \textrm{tan}^{-1} ( \frac{T_m}{2 \Delta \Phi} )$ such that prior
  to mirroring and for $\Delta \Phi > T_m$, the majority of the phase
  space density of the precipitating electron beam is contained within
  the pitch angle range $ \vert \theta \vert < \phi_T$.  This angle
  range implies the condition $R_B \geq R_{B,T} \equiv 4 (
  \frac{E_b}{T} )^2 + 1$ for production of an isotropic distribution
  function as the beam moves into an increasingly stronger magnetic
  field. For $\Delta \Phi \simeq 1.3$~kV and $T =$~600~eV, $\phi_T =
  13.0^\circ$ and $R_{B,T} = 19.8$.

  A possible objection to this interpretation centers on secondary
  electron production (cite cite). A more conservative estimate is
  that after mirroring (as has been assumed for
  Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig2}b), $\phi_T =$~30$^\circ$ and therefore $R_{B,T}
  =$~4.9.

  \dots

  I conclude that the kappa scenario seems a little more likely.

 %  using the Tsyganenko~01 and IGRF~12 magnetic field models.

  % For each fit the temperature and density is specified as the
  % observed average during the respective period; that is, temperature
  % and density are fixed. Figures~\ref{ch6:Fig1}e and \ref{ch6:Fig1}f show that
  % temperature and density are steady during the periods between bars.
  % With temperature and density fixed the only variable parameter is
  % the magnetic ratio $R_B$, with an upper bound of
  % $R_{B,\mathrm{max}}=10^4$ (essentially infinity), and for the kappa
  % J-V fit $\kappa$ is also allowed to vary.

  % The legend in each panel shows that the current densities predicted

  % $\kappa \simeq 1.5$, whereas Knight relation fall significantly
  % below the observed current densities; setting $R_{B,\mathrm{max}} =

  % observed current densities at the inferred potential, without
  % reference to the kappa values arising from fits of individual
  % electron distributions (Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}c).

  Figure~4 shows FAST electron ESA observations during orbit 1843,
  which were originally reported by \citet{Ergun1998a}. 

  My estimation on the basis of Figures~\ref{ch6:Fig4} and \ref{ch6:Fig5}
  ($\Delta \Phi = 1E4, T = 2000 \Rightarrow \phi_T = 5.7^\circ,
  R_{B,T} = 100$) indicates that these electrons are pretty close to
  the old isotropic condition.

  \section{Discussion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(Outline)

\begin{itemize}
\item Adiabatic field-aligned transport seems to favor the kappa interpretation
\item Previous reports \citep{Olsson1998,Ogasawara2006,Kaeppler2014a}
  found $\kappa \geq$~2.5; still in ``near-equilibrium'' regime
\item We find $\kappa \simeq$~1.5 (theoretical minimum)
\item $\kappa <$~4 shown in Christon et al. [1992], Kletzing et
  al. [2003], but not discussed
\item We are in process of undertaking a large statistical study of
  FAST observations to seek to determine the conditions leading to
  development of highly nonthermal distributions in the magnetotail.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A preliminary investigation suggests geomagnetically quiet
    periods favor production of ``far-equilibrium'' ($\kappa
    \leq$~2.5) distributions, though statistical work with DMSP
    satellites \citep[e.g., Figure~7 in][]{McIntosh2014} seems to
    represent counterevidence.
  \end{itemize}
\item As attention turns increasingly to dynamic M-I coupling,
  observations presented in this Letter indicate the possibility that
  the consequences of nonthermal magnetospheric populations (as
  indicated here by the kappa index) are not ignorable either in the
  development of first principles--based models of auroral
  precipiation, or in the study and interpretation of magnetospheric
  energization and acceleration processes
\item Bostr\"{o}m's work seems to me to be the best for understanding
  accessibility/space charge effects
\end{itemize}

and recent theoretical work \citep{Khazanov2015,Khazanov2016}
indicates that magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, wave-particle
interactions, and multiple atmospheric reflections are all necessary
ingredients for producing the observed distributions.

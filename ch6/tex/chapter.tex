  We report direct in-situ measurements through the auroral acceleration region
  that reveal the prevalence of extremely nonthermal monoenergetic electron
  distributions. These auroral primaries are indicative of source populations in
  the plasma sheet well described as kappa distributions with $\kappa
  \lesssim$~2. We show from observations and modeling how this large deviation
  from Maxwellian form modifies the the acceleration potential required to drive
  current closure through the auroral ionosphere. This violation of the
  classically assumed relationship between field-aligned current and auroral
  acceleration potential has fundamental implications for present-day
  understanding of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling that should be incorporated
  in global magnetospheric models.

  \section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  The development of quasi-steady potential differences along geomagnetic field
  lines connecting the plasma sheet and high-latitude magnetosphere to the
  ionosphere is a consequence of the requirement for current closure by hot
  tenuous electrons through a strong converging magnetic
  field. \citet{Knight1973} formally demonstrated the relationship between a
  field-aligned, monotonic potential profile characterized by a total potential
  difference $\Delta \Phi$ and the the corresponding field-aligned current
  density at the ionosphere $j_{\parallel,i}$ generated by precipitation of
  magnetospheric particles subject to a magnetic mirror ratio $R_B = B_{i} /
  B_{m}$,
  % \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation} \label{ch6:eqKnight} j_{\parallel,i} ( \, \Delta \Phi ; T_m,
    n_m, R_B ) = - e n_m \Big ( \dfrac{k_B T_m}{2 \pi m_e} \Big )^{\frac{1}{2}}
    R_B \Bigg [ 1 - \Big ( 1 - R_B^{-1} \Big ) \textrm{exp} \Big \{ - \dfrac{e
      \Delta \Phi}{k_B T_m ( R_B - 1 )} \Big \} \Bigg],
  \end{equation}
  % \end{linenomath*}
  where $T_m$ and $n_m$ are respectively the temperature and density of
  precipitating electrons at the magnetospheric source.

  % From Boström [2003]:
  % Observations of auroral electron, and ionospheric ion, acceleration
  % [e.g., Reiffetal., 1988; Lundin and Eliasson, 1991, and references
  % therein], electric fields [Mozer and Hull, 2001] and the AKR source
  % region [e.g., Bahnsen et al., 1989] suggest that the acceleration
  % occurs at altitudes of 1–2 RE which corresponds to z = 8–30 (for
  % flux tubes with the ionospheric end at a magnetic latitude of 70? or
  % more) although a strict limit to the acceleration region may be
  % difficult to establish experimentally

  Equation (\ref{ch6:eqKnight}) is an example of a current voltage (J-V)
  relation (specifically the Knight relation) that elucidates the role of
  field-aligned potential differences within the large-scale current system
  connecting the magnetosphere, and has led in part to present understanding of
  the magnetosphere-ionosphere current system
  \citep[e.g.,][]{Temerin1997,Hultqvist1999,Cowley2000,Bostrom2003a,Paschmann2003,Pierrard2007a,Karlsson2012}.

  The Knight relation assumes that the magnetospheric source population is in
  thermal equilibrium and is thus described by the Maxwellian distribution
  % \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation} \label{ch6:eqMax1D} f_{M}( E ; T, n) \, = n \Big (
    \dfrac{m}{2 \pi k_{B} T} \Big )^{\frac{3}{2}} \textrm{exp} \Big (
    - \dfrac{E}{ k_B T } \Big ).
  \end{equation}
  % \end{linenomath*}
  The spectral shape of this distribution is governed by the parameters $T$ and
  $n$, and neglects the suprathermal tails of magnetospheric electron and ion
  distributions that have often been observed by in situ spacecraft. The first
  such reports appeared almost three decades ago
  \citep{Christon1989,Christon1991}, which were followed by reports of
  suprathermal tail observations at low altitudes (<~1000~km) and in the
  high-latitude plasma sheet \citep{Wing1998,Kletzing2003}.

  Despite more frequent association at ionospheric altitudes with diffuse, or
  unaccelerated, precipitation than with accelerated precipitation \citep[see,
  e.g., ][]{Newell2009,McIntosh2014}, the possibility of a source distribution
  with a ``high energy tail'' was in fact acknowledged by \citet{Knight1973},
  and reformulations of the J-V relation (\ref{ch6:eqKnight}) assuming a variety
  of alternative source distributions have since been developed
  \citep{Pierrard1996,Janhunen1998,Dors1999,Bostrom2003a,Bostrom2004}.

  One such alternative distribution employed with increasing frequency is the
  kappa distribution \citep{Livadiotis2013}
  % \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation} \label{ch6:eqKappa1D} f_{\kappa}(E; T, n, \kappa) = n \Bigg
      ( \dfrac{m}{2 \pi (\kappa - \frac{3}{2}) k_{B} T \, } \Bigg
      )^{\frac{3}{2}} \dfrac{\Gamma \big ( \kappa + 1 \big ) }{\Gamma \big (
        \kappa - \frac{1}{2} \big ) } \Bigg ( 1 + \dfrac{E}{ \big ( \kappa -
        \frac{3}{2} \big ) k_B T } \Bigg )^{-1 - \kappa},
    \end{equation}
  % \end{linenomath*}
  which originally entered the space physics community as a model for
  high-energy tails of observed solar wind plasmas
  \citep{Vasyliunas1968}. Relaxing the assumption of a magnetospheric source
  population in thermal equilibrium, \citet{Dors1999} showed that the J-V
  relation (\ref{ch6:eqKnight}) becomes
  % \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{align}
      \label{ch6:eqDors}
      \begin{array}{ll}
        j_{\parallel,i} ( \, \Delta \Phi ; T_m, n_m, \kappa, R_B ) &= - e n_m \sqrt{ \dfrac{ k_B T_m (\kappa -
            \frac{3}{2})}{ 2 \pi m_e}} \dfrac{\Gamma (\kappa + 1)}{\Gamma (\kappa - \frac{1}{2})} \dfrac{R_B}{\kappa (\kappa - 1)} \\
        &\times \Bigg[1 - \Big(1 - R_B^{-1} \Big) \Bigg(1+\dfrac{e \Delta \Phi}{ k_B
          T_m (\kappa - \frac{3}{2})(R_B - 1)} \Bigg)^{1-\kappa} \Bigg].
      \end{array}
    \end{align}
  % \end{linenomath*}
  The additional parameter $\kappa \in [ \, 3/2, \infty )$ in the distribution
  (\ref{ch6:eqKappa1D}) and J-V relation (\ref{ch6:eqDors}) parameterizes the
  degree to which particle motion is correlated, and is therefore related to
  the ``thermodynamic distance'' between a given stationary, non-equilibrium
  state and thermal equilibrium. The theoretical minimum (in three dimensions)
  $\kappa_{\textrm{min}} = 3/2$ corresponds to perfectly correlated motion of
  particles while $\kappa \rightarrow \infty$ corresponds to uncorrelated
  motion of particles, or thermal equilibrium
  \citep{Livadiotis2010,Livadiotis2011,Livadiotis2013}. 

  \citet{Livadiotis2010} review both theoretical and observational evidence
  suggesting that $\kappa_t \simeq 2.45$ marks a transition between stationary
  states that are far from thermal equilibrium, $\kappa \in [ \, 3/2, \kappa_T
  )$, and ``near-equilibrium'' states for which $\kappa \in [ \, \kappa_T,
  \infty )$, as well as evidence of a preferred ``fundamental state'' with
  $\kappa \simeq 1.63$ that corresponds to the minimum-entropy kappa
  distribution.

  Regarding physical origins, a host of mechanisms leading to production of a
  suprathermal tail exist \citep[e.g., review by][]{Pierrard2010}, many of which
  are instances of the general process by which superdiffusivity arises in a
  geometrically constrained, crowded driven physical system
  \citep{Benichou2013}.  The correlated particle motion accompanying
  non-equilibrium stationarity also arises in processes exhibiting self-similar,
  or fractal, scales; hence its connection with turbulent and scale-invariant
  processes \citep{West1990,Treumann1999a,Leubner2004}.

  In this chapter we reexamine previously reported FAST observations of
  precipitating monoenergetic electrons above the auroral ionosphere, and find
  instances of magnetospheric source populations in stationary states that are
  far from thermal equilibrium.

  \section{Observations and Distribution Modeling}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  Using 2-D model distributions based on either a 1-D Maxwellian distribution
  (\ref{ch6:eqMax1D}) or a 1-D kappa distribution (\ref{ch6:eqKappa1D}), we
  perform fits to the electron precipitation within the precipitating loss cone
  as measured by FAST electrostatic analyzers (ESAs) \citep{Carlson2001}. Four
  adjustable parameters are used for the kappa distribution and three parameters
  for the Maxwellian distribution. The parameters common to each distribution
  are $E^*$ (discussed momentarily), $T$, and $n$; the fourth parameter $\kappa$
  is used only for the kappa distribution. For some applications
  \citep[e.g.,][]{Sutherland2012} it may be useful to relate the kinetic
  temperature of the kappa distribution to a thermalized ``core temperature''
  $T_c = T (1-3/2 \kappa)$. The distinction is not made in this study, however,
  since the kinetic and thermodynamic definitions of temperature are consistent
  for each type of distribution \citep{Livadiotis2010}.

  Several authors \citep{Maggs1981,Bingham1999,Bingham2000,Mutel2007} have
  modeled 2-D distributions with the general form
  % \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation} \label{ch6:eq2DMod} f_{2D}(\, E^*, \theta ; T, n,
      \kappa) \, = f_{1D}(\, E^*; T, n, \kappa) \, g(\, \theta),
    \end{equation}
  % \end{linenomath*}
  where $E^*$ and $\theta$ are respectively the (possibly modified) electron
  energy and pitch angle, $f_{1D}$ is either the 1-D Maxwellian distribution
  (\ref{ch6:eqMax1D}) or the 1-D kappa distribution (\ref{ch6:eqKappa1D}), and
  $g(\theta )$ is a function describing, for example, the effects of the mirror
  force or the maser instability on the source distribution. Each group of
  authors employing the 2-D model (\ref{ch6:eq2DMod}) prescribe various forms
  for $g(\theta)$. An alternative strategy presented by \citet{Pritchett1999}
  involves reduction of observed 2-D distributions to one dimension via
  integration.

      energy range, and over all angles except those within the anti-earthward
      loss cone. Uncertainties of observed temperatures and densities are
      calculated using analytic expressions for moment uncertainties of an
      arbitrary plasma distribution function [\citealt{Gershman2015}; see
      Appendix~A]. This time interval was first studied by \citet{Elphic1998}}
    \label{ch6:Fig1}
  \end{figure}

  % ----------------

  The focus of this study is the portion of the source population within the
  earthward loss cone. We therefore use $g(\theta) =$~1 in the 2-D model
  (\ref{ch6:eq2DMod}) and assume the electron energy $E$ is offset by a
  field-aligned potential drop $\Delta \Phi$, or $E^* = \big( \sqrt{e \Delta
    \Phi} - \sqrt{E} \big)^2$.

  Our procedure for estimating the parameters of $f_{2D}$ in (\ref{ch6:eq2DMod})
  from measured electron distributions is the following: first, a 1-D
  differential energy flux spectrum is calculated by averaging the differential
  energy flux at each energy over the range of angles within the precipitating
  loss cone (sometimes referred to as the source cone), after which a 1-D fit of
  the resulting average spectrum is performed. Parameters from the 1-D fit are
  then used as the initial estimate of the parameters used to perform a direct
  2-D fit of the observed differential energy flux distribution over a range of
  energies and angles selected to avoid inclusion of possible secondaries and
  other background populations. The range of angles includes all within the
  precipitating loss cone; the range of energies extends
  from two energy bins below that in which the peak energy flux is observed to
  the ESA energy limit at 30~keV. Throughout this study the reported fit
  parameters are those resulting from 2-D fits.

  \section{FAST Orbit 1773}

  During an approximately 60-s interval on Feb 1, 1997 that has previously been
  reported \citep{Elphic1998,Chaston2002b}, the FAST satellite observed inverted
  V electron precipitation (Figures~\ref{ch6:Fig1}a and \ref{ch6:Fig1}b) and
  intermittent upgoing ion beams (not shown) near midnight MLT during a period
  of low geomagnetic activity ($K_p =$~1$^-$).

  Performing 2-D fits of the electron distributions within the precipitating
  loss cone shows that many of the distributions are highly nonthermal, with
  $\kappa \lesssim$~2.0 (Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}c). Values of the reduced
  chi-squared statistic $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}} = \frac{\sum_i Y(x) -
    y_i(x)}{\mathrm{dof}}$ for 2-D fits with a kappa distribution are at times
  much smaller than corresponding $\chi^2_{\textrm{red}}$ values for fits with a
  Maxwellian distribution (Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}c), most markedly during the
  period between red bars (09:26:54--09:27:05~UT) in Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1} when
  $\kappa$ is frequently near the theoretical minimum $\kappa_{\mathrm{min}}
  =$~3/2.

  As a representative example of electron observations during the period between
  bars in Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}, Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig2} shows a 1-D slice and the
  full 2-D distribution observed at 09:27:00.94~UT.  In Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}a
  the 1-D best-fit kappa and Maxwellian distributions (blue dashed line and red
  dash-dotted line, respectively) overlay the observed distribution (black
  crosses). The best-fit kappa distribution is seen to describe both the
  suprathermal tail and the narrow peak of the observed distribution, whereas
  the best-fit Maxwellian distribution fails to describe the suprathermal tail
  but is able to describe the narrow peak via a best-fit temperature that is low
  compared to the observed temperature (40~eV versus $\sim$600~eV).

  Typical ranges of electron densities and temperatures in the distant plasma
  sheet are respectively 0.01--0.5~cm$^{-3}$ and 400-900~eV
  \citep{Kletzing2003,Paschmann2003}. Figures~\ref{ch6:Fig1}e--f show that
  within the inverted V precipitation, the observed (black diamonds) and
  best-fit kappa distribution (blue \emph{x} symbols) densities and temperatures
  are within these typical ranges; best-fit Maxwellian densities are also within
  the corresponding typically observed range, but the range of best-fit
  Maxwellian temperatures is somewhat low (20--300~eV) compared to the
  corresponding typical range in the plasma sheet.

  % ----------------

  To independently infer $\kappa$, or the degree to which the magnetospheric
  source population is in a nonthermal stationary state, we use the J-V
  relations (\ref{ch6:eqKnight}) and (\ref{ch6:eqDors}), to fit observed
  potential drops $\Delta \Phi$ and electron current densities $j_{\parallel,i}$
  that have been mapped to 100~km. The necessary elements are a reliable set of
  measurements of $\Delta \Phi$ and $j_{\parallel,i}$ from which to form an
  observed J-V relation, which can then be compared with a predicted J-V
  relation, and the parameters $P_m = \{ n_m, T_m, R_B, \kappa \, \}$, which
  represent the source population in the magnetosphere and are to be used as
  inputs for J-V relations (\ref{ch6:eqKnight}) and (\ref{ch6:eqDors}). In lieu
  of in situ magnetosphere observations, we infer $P_m$ on the basis of FAST
  measurements.

  To form pairs of ($j_{\parallel,i}, \Delta \Phi$) observations suitable for
  comparing with theory, $j_\parallel$ is calculated from observed velocity
  distributions over the range of pitch angles within the precipitating loss
  cone, and over all energies exceeding 300~eV.  $j_{\parallel,i}$ is then
  obtained by mapping $j_\parallel$ to 100~km using International Geomagnetic
  Reference Field 11. The corresponding total potential drop $\Delta \Phi =
  \bar{E}_e + \bar{E}_i$ (white dotted line, Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}b) is then
  calculated, where $\bar{E}_e$ is the average source-cone electron energy and
  $\bar{E}_i$ is that of the upgoing ion beam, if present, and zero
  otherwise. The average energy is defined as the ratio of energy flux and
  number flux moments, calculated within the earthward portion of the loss cone
  for electrons, and the anti-earthward portion of the loss cone for ions.

  In practice only a small number of observed J-V pairs $( j_{\parallel,i} ,
  \Delta \Phi )$ are suitable for our purposes: both Maxwellian and kappa J-V
  relations (\ref{ch6:eqKnight}) (\ref{ch6:eqDors}) require a single set of
  magnetospheric source parameters $P_m$, which in turn requires identification
  of periods during which observed $P_m$ are sufficiently steady to be
  meaningfully related to the putative source population. Perhaps not
  coincidentally, the period shown in Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1} during which $\kappa
  \lesssim 2$ (09:26:54--09:27:05~UT) also delineates a period during which the
  observed density, temperature, and $\kappa$ are relatively steady. Parameter
  estimates before this period are dubious, since \citep{Chaston2002b} have
  reported that the particle observations before this period are immersed in
  strong coherent ion cyclotron wave emission at frequencies faster than the ESA
  sampling frequency and are therefore subject to aliasing.

  Having identified an appropriate set of observations, we now describe our
  methodology for estimating the source parameters $P_m$. The extreme values of
  $\kappa$ (Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}c) together with the steady temperatures
  (Figures~\ref{ch6:Fig1}e) and densities (Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}f) during the
  period of interest imply adiabatic field-aligned transport, i.e., $T_m$ and
  $\kappa$ are largely unmodified in undergoing transport from the
  magnetospheric source region to FAST altitudes. The average observed
  temperature $\bar{T}_F =$~627.9~eV during this period is therefore identified
  as the source temperature $T_m$, and is treated as a fixed parameter (i.e.,
  $T_m$ is not allowed to vary), but $\kappa$ is initialized with $\kappa =$~10
  and is allowed to vary as part of the fitting procedure.
  
  From the vantage point of the magnetosphere-ionosphere transition region, the
  two remaining parameters $n_m$ and $R_B$ are tied as a consequence of the
  mirror force and the frozen-in flux condition. Confident estimation of each
  parameter solely on the basis of the observations in Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}
  presents the most serious challenge to this analysis. We assume the source
  density $n_m$ is a function of the total electron density at FAST $n_F$
  (excluding the density within the range of anti-earthward angles within which
  the source population has already been depleted), the mirror ratio between
  FAST and the magnetospheric source $R_{B,F} = B_\textrm{FAST} / B_m$ (as
  opposed to the magnetosphere-ionosphere mirror ratio $R_B$), and potential
  drop $\Delta \Phi$ via the relationship \citep{Ratner1976,Barbosa1977}
  \begin{subequations}
    \begin{align} n_m \big ( n_F, \bar{\phi}, \alpha_F \big ) &= \dfrac{n_F}{Q \big ( \bar{\phi}, \alpha_F \big ) }, \\
      Q \big ( \bar{\phi}, \alpha_F \big ) &\equiv 1 + 2 \big ( 1 - \alpha_F
      \big ) \dfrac{ \bar{\phi}^{1/2} \, e^{- \alpha_F \bar{\phi}}
      }{\textrm{erfc} \big ( - \bar{\phi}^{1/2} \big )} { \displaystyle
        \int_{-\sqrt{\bar{\phi}}}^{\infty} } \, dx \, e^{\alpha_F x^2} \,
      \textrm{erfc} \big ( x \big ), \label{ch6:eqBarbosa}
    \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
  % \end{linenomath*}
  %   \end{equation}
  % \end{linenomath*}
  where $\bar{\phi} = \Delta \Phi / k_B T $ and $\alpha_F = 1 /
  R_{B,F}$. Equation (\ref{ch6:eqBarbosa}) is a sigmoid function \citep[Figure
  1b][]{Barbosa1977} that describes how the number density of a hot plasma beam
  moving adiabatically into a region of converging magnetic field lines is
  modified by field-line compression and the mirror force. Since $n_F$ is fixed
  by observation, (\ref{ch6:eqBarbosa}) specifies the relationship between
  $R_{B,F}$ and $n_m$. The final issue is estimation of $R_B$, or equivalently
  $R_{B,F}$.

  Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig3}a displays contours of $\chi^2_{\textrm{red}} ( \kappa,
  R_B )$, where
  \begin{subequations}
    \begin{align} \chi^2_{\mathrm{red}} = \dfrac{\sum_i j_{\parallel,i} (\Delta \Phi) - j_{\textrm{pred}\parallel,i}(\Delta \Phi; P_m)}{\mathrm{dof}}; \\
      P_m = \Big \{ n_m ( \hat{n}_F, \bar{\phi} , \alpha_F ), \hat{T}_m, R_B,
      \kappa \, \Big \}. \label{paramFit}
    \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
  Parameters with hats in (\ref{paramFit}) are fixed, and
  $j_{\textrm{pred}\parallel,i} $ is the current density predicted either by J-V
  relation (\ref{ch6:eqKnight}) or (\ref{ch6:eqDors}). Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig3}a
  indicates that only two scenarios are plausible: one involves a source
  population that is located at or beyond $\sim$4.7~$R_E$ and is extremely
  nonthermal ($\kappa \lesssim 1.7$); the other involves acceleration at
  altitudes near FAST and below $\sim$2.2~$R_E$.

  Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig3}b shows the observed J-V relation (black plus signs, with
  error bars calculated as described in Appendix~A), and best-fit nonthermal and
  thermal J-V relations given correspondingly by equation (\ref{ch6:eqKnight})
  (blued dashed line) and equation (\ref{ch6:eqDors}) (red dash-dotted
  line). The best-fit nonthermal J-V relation, or that for which
  $\chi^2_{\textrm{red}} ( \kappa, R_B )$ is the global minimum in
  Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig3}a, is given by $\kappa =$~1.58 and $R_B =$799, or a
  source at $\sim$9~$R_E$ (though Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig3}a shows that sources as
  close as $\sim$4.8~$R_E$ are similarly plausible for $\kappa \simeq$~1.6). The
  best-fit thermal J-V relation, for which $\kappa \rightarrow \infty$, is
  obtained for $R_B =$~8.6, corresponding to a source at $\sim$2~$R_E$.

  In the top panel of Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig3}, the cause of the large gap in
  ($\kappa, R_B$) parameter space that separates these scenarios is bifold; each
  has to do with the linearity condition $\Delta \Phi / k_B T \ll R_B $. First,
  relative to the thermal J-V relation (\ref{ch6:eqKnight}), for $\kappa
  \lesssim 2.5$ the kappa J-V relation (\ref{ch6:eqDors}) is greatly influenced
  by saturation effects, which arise as the linearity condition is
  violated. Second, for equal number density and temperature, the current
  density predicted by the kappa J-V relation (\ref{ch6:eqDors}) with $\kappa
  \simeq 1.65$ is more than double the current density predicted by the
  Maxwellian J-V relation (\ref{ch6:eqKnight}) at $\bar{\phi} =$~10, for
  example.

  As a result, a highly nonthermal source population is plausible in
  Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig3}a in two cases: (1) The source population is distant
  ($\gtrsim$~4.7~$R_E$) so that according to equation (\ref{ch6:eqBarbosa}) the
  source density is reduced relative to the density observed at FAST. The much
  higher current predicted by the kappa J-V relation for extremely nonthermal
  $\kappa$ values compensates for the reduced number density. (2) The source
  population is nearby ($<$~2.2~$R_E$) so that the much higher number density
  compensates for current saturation effects.

  The distinction to be borne in mind is that according to
  $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}}$ values shown in the top panel of \ref{ch6:Fig3} a
  highly nonthermal source is compatible with either a nearby or a distant
  source region, but a source in thermal equilibrium is only compatible with a
  nearby source region. 

  Importantly, the electron distributions in Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig2} exhibit a
  very pronounced high-energy tail, which argues strongly against a source in
  thermal equilibrium and therefore against a nearby source. We now attempt to
  observationally constrain $R_B$ by assuming that acceleration of the
  precipitating electron population occurs prior to pitch-angle spreading due to
  the mirror force. The nearly isotropic, shell-like appearance of 2-D
  distributions during the period of interest in Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}, of which
  Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig2}b is an example, seems to justify this assumption. On
  this point \citet{Bostrom2003a} has observed, ``If some preacceleration has
  taken place at much higher altitudes the mirror effect will make the
  distribution look more like an isotropically accelerated distribution.''

  With the foregoing assumption of preacceleration we define a ``thermal angle''
  $\phi_T = \textrm{tan}^{-1} ( \frac{T_m}{2 \Delta \Phi} )$ such that prior to
  mirroring and for $\Delta \Phi > T_m$, the majority of the phase space density
  of the precipitating electron beam is contained within the pitch angle range $
  \theta < \phi_T$. As the beam moves toward lower altitudes, the mirror ratio
  for which all beam particles with pitch angles $\theta \geq \phi_T$ undergo
  mirroring is
  \begin{equation} \label{ch6:RBTherm} R_{B,T} = \dfrac{1}{\mathrm{sin}^2 \big
      (\phi_T \big ) } = 4 \Big ( \dfrac{E_b}{T} \Big )^2 + 1.
  \end{equation}
  Provided the electron beam does not mix with secondary populations, the beam
  distribution appears increasingly shell-like (or ``isotropically
  accelerated'') as electrons originally at pitch angles $\vert \theta \vert <
  \phi_T$ spread over an increasing range of angles by virtue of the mirror
  force. Upon reaching low altitudes for which $R_B \gtrsim R_{B,T}$, the
  electron distribution appears almost entirely shell-like except within the
  anti-earthward portion of the losscone.

  If this scenario is assumed to be true for the precipitating electrons
  observed during the period of interest in Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}, and for
  $\Delta \Phi \simeq 850$~V and $T =$~600~eV, one obtains $\phi_T = 19^\circ$
  and therefore $R_{B,T} = 9$. The abscissa of the top panel in
  Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig3} shows that $R_{B,T} = 9$ corresponds to minimum source
  altitude $R_E \approx 2$.
  % \simeq 1.3$~kV and $T =$~600~eV, $\phi_T = 13^\circ$ and $R_{B,T} =
  % 19.8$.
  The shell-like distributions observed throughout the period of interest in
  Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1} therefore suggest that the source region is
  located at or above $\geq$2~$R_E$.

  In view of the combined evidences from Figures~\ref{ch6:Fig1} and
  \ref{ch6:Fig2}, which indicate $\kappa \simeq$~1.7, and the shell-like
  morphologies of the observed electron distributions, which appear to indicate
  a minimum source altitude $R_E \approx 2$, the only consistent scenario in the
  top panel of Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig3} involves a relatively distant
  ($\gtrsim$~4.7~$R_E$) and highly nonthermal source region.

  % A possible objection to this interpretation centers on secondary
  % electron production (cite cite). A more conservative estimate is

  % Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig2}b), $\phi_T =$~30$^\circ$ and therefore $R_{B,T}

  Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig4} shows electron ESA observations on Feb 7, 1997 during
  FAST orbit 1843, in the same layout as Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}. These
  observations were originally reported by \citet{Ergun1998a,Ergun1998}, and
  while those authors used burst-mode ESA observations, we present survey-mode
  observations in order to improve the uncertainty related to counting
  statistics in the calculated temperatures and densities
  (Appendix~\ref{app:A}).

  \citet{Ergun1998} used observations of auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) to
  conclude that the source region for the precipitating electrons in
  Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig4} lies ``near the apogee of FAST.''  We may compare this
  information about the source region altitude, which was derived from the FAST
  fields instrument \citep{Ergun2001}, with the results of an analysis of orbit
  1843 paralleling the analysis of orbit 1773 in the previous section.

  During the period 20:49:48--20:50:11~UT between red bars, the observed
  properties of the electrons within the precipitating loss cone are $\kappa
  \simeq $~1.55--2.5, $T =$~2--3~keV, and $n =$~0.7--1.0~cm$^{-3}$. In contrast
  with the marked period in Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig1}c, during which $\kappa < 1.7$
  over most of the marked period, Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig4}c instead shows $\kappa >
  2$ over much of the period of interest during this orbit.

  Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig4} shows $T \simeq$~2.3~keV; the assumption $E_b > T$
  underpinning the definition of $\phi_T$ is therefore valid, and the
  corresponding mirror ratio for which any particle with pitch angle $\vert
  \theta \vert < \phi_T$ is $R_{B,T} = 22$ or equivalently an altitude of
  approximately 2.5~$R_E$. The rapid dropoff in differential flux with
  increasing pitch angle suggests, however, that the isotropic condition is not
  satisfied. Therefore, we assume the mirror ratio between the source region and
  FAST is $R_B \lesssim R_{B,T}$, or equivalently, that the source altitude is
  approximately at or below 2.5~$R_E$.

  scenarios shown in Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig3}a, a distant nonthermal source, a
  nearby nonthermal source, and a thermal source, are also evident in
  Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig6}a. Because $\kappa$ often exceeds 2 in
  Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig4}, and because Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig5} argues that $R_B$
  cannot exceed $\sim$22, the likelihood of a distant nonthermal source is
  remote; instead, the balance of the evidence in this case is in favor of a
  source population at less than 2.5~$R_E$. This conclusion about the source
  altitude is compatible with the work of \citet{Ergun1998} discussed at the
  beginning of this section.
  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \section{Discussion and Conclusions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  We have performed analyses of orbits 1773 and 1843 in parallel fashion. In the
  former case we conclude that the evidence is in favor of a highly nonthermal
  source with $\kappa < 1.7$ at altitudes near or exceeding 4.7~$R_E$. In the
  latter case we conclude that the balance of the evidence is in favor of a
  source that is nonthermal (though less so than the former case) with $\kappa
  \simeq 2$, at an altitude not exceeding $\sim$2.5~$R_E$ apparently in
  connection with AKR.

  The results of this study suggest that a nonthermal source population may
  significantly modify the Knight relation. Given the restriction on source
  regions to $>$~4.7~$R_E$, the results in Figure~\ref{ch6:Fig3}a in particular
  show that the observed J-V relation is only compatible with a highly
  nonthermal source population. Further study is clearly necessary to determine
  both the conditions leading to development of highly nonthermal distributions,
  as well as the source altitude.

  Regarding the occurrence frequency of highly nonthermal populations, we have
  conducted a preliminary examination of previously reported FAST observations
  of inverted V precipitation
  \citep{McFadden1998a,Carlson2001,Janhunen2001,Dombeck2013}, which suggest
  geomagnetically quiet periods favor production of ``far-equilibrium'' ($\kappa
  \leq$~2.5) distributions, though recent statistical work with DMSP satellites
  seems to represent counterevidence, with precipitation that is best fit with a
  kappa distribution occurring more regularly during active periods \citep[e.g.,
  Figure~7 in][]{McIntosh2014}.

  Results from analysis of orbit 1773 could represent the low-altitude
  counterpart of observations reported by \citet{Wygant2002} and
  \citet{Schriver2003}, where the former have stated ``in addition to the
  auroral particle energization processes known to occur at altitudes between
  0.5 and 2~$R_E$, there are important heating and acceleration mechanisms
  operating at these higher altitudes in the plasma sheet.'' \textbf{Good
    point. Although earlier you said it could safely be assumed that their was
    nothing in between.}

  Previous studies of precipitating electrons in or below the
  magnetosphere-ionosphere transition region and involving kappa distributions
  \citep{Olsson1998,Ogasawara2006,Kaeppler2014a} have reported $\kappa
  \geq$~2.5, values which are within the ``near-equilibrium'' regime
  \citep{Livadiotis2010}, meaning the corresponding distributions do not deviate
  strongly from a Maxwellian distribution. In this study we have reported
  distributions with $\kappa \simeq$~1.6.

  In situ magnetosphere and plasma sheet observations
  \citet{Christon1989,Christon1991,Kletzing2003} have shown $\kappa <$~4 , but
  these were not discussed.

  Passing mention is owed to some existing reports in the literature showing
  $\kappa < 1.5$ and even $\kappa \simeq$~0, but because the three-dimensional
  theoretical minimum $\kappa_{\mathrm{min}} =$~3/2 corresponds to a correlation
  coefficient of 1, or perfectly correlated particle motion, how these results
  were obtained is unclear.

  As attention turns increasingly to dynamic M-I coupling, observations
  presented in this Letter indicate the possibility that the effects of
  deviation from thermal equilibrium (as parameterized by $\kappa$ in the
  present work) may not be ignorable either in the development of first
  principles--based models of auroral precipitation, or in the study and
  interpretation of magnetospheric energization and acceleration processes.

% \textbf{CHRIS: You could emphasize the basic difference of your
%     observations here relative to those done previously. Some of which were in
%     the collisional topside ionosphere. Your work is the first to be performed
%     in the acceleration region - clear from contamination of secondaries etc and

%     indirectly above but you could emphasize that this may be why you get lower
%     Kappa than kletzing et al.  This is really nice work Spencer. I had to think
%     hard to keep up with the text you on this. }

abstract = {We identify two distinct electron populations associated with Alfv{\'{e}}n waves in the Freja data set using the high time resolution state of the art electron detector. One of the populations, detected together with an Alfv{\'{e}}n wave, is field-aligned and can be seen as trapped within the wave. The other electron population is detected before the wave and consists of electrons which have left the wave at a point with a velocity higher than the local Alfv{\'{e}}n speed. In the paper, the electrons leaving wave are modeled for different density profiles and are compared with the observed data. Depending on the density profile, the model can produce the same energy-time and pitch angle-time dispersion that is observed in the Freja data. The conclusion of the paper is that the Alfv{\'{e}}n wave can explain the observed particle signatures. It is shown that the Alfv{\'{e}}n wave acceleration can create electron signatures similar to inverted-V structures. The density distribution along a flux tube has an important role in the type of particle signatures that can be detected at low altitudes.},

abstract = {The Cluster spacecraft often cross the midaltitude cleft/cusp and observe a very well defined "electron-only cleft'' region consisting of electron injections without magnetosheath ions. This region contains soft suprathermal ({\textless}500 eV) electron bursts in antifield and/or field-aligned directions. We present an example of such observations which shows that the O+ ion outflow at midaltitudes appears just poleward of the open-closed boundary simultaneously with electron injections and was observed in the cleft, cusp, and mantle in the form of narrow energy beam. Inside the "electron-only'' cleft the suprathermal electron bursts are strongly correlated with strong O+ and H+ ion heating and with localized extra low frequency (ELF) (1-10 Hz) magnetic field wave power with broadband spectra. Our study shows that strong ion heating was observed only in the region with electron field-aligned anisotropy more than 2. In addition, comparison of particle data from two spacecraft, which crossed the heating region with a time difference of 4 min, shows the correlation between ion outflow fluxes and fluxes of the injected electrons. Whereas ELF electromagnetic waves are localized inside the ion heating region, ELF electrostatic waves are detected throughout the cleft/cusp/mantle regions, where strong ion heating was not observed, suggesting that electromagnetic ELF waves heat ions in the cleft region. Owing to the absence of magnetosheath ions and strong field-aligned currents, we suppose that inside "electron-only'' cleft region the suprathermal electron bursts are most likely an energy source for the wave destabilization. We suggest that the location of the heating region and the level of the outflow ion fluxes could be related to electron injection in the cleft in such events.},

@article{Bostrom2003a,
abstract = {The current–voltage characteristic of magnetospheric magnetic flux tubes is studied under rather general conditions, assuming the current to be carried by collision-free particles experiencing inertia, electric forces, and magnetic mirror forces. The approach is that of the powerful kinetic “orbital motion” theory of current collectors in plasma as developed by H. M. Mott-Smith and I. Langmuir in 1926. When C. Davisson's 1925 condition on particle access is fulfilled, the total voltage drop is uniquely determined from the current by kinetic/geometric considerations only, without considerations of the actual space charge and electrostatic potential distribution. For any velocity distribution that is isotropic within the source cone, the current–voltage characteristic is linear for sufficiently small currents. The nature of the corresponding global flux tube electric resistance is discussed. The current–voltage characteristic is given for a variety of distribution functions (where the Maxwellian case corresponds to that studied by S. Knight in 1973) including distributions with a reduced (nonisotropic) flux in the source cone. The current–voltage characteristic is also discussed for cases where the Davisson condition is not fulfilled, when the solution method provides a lower bound on the voltage for a given current. Making assumptions on the altitude extent of the voltage drop, we can also define an upper bound on the voltage for a particular current. The magnetospheric source of particles should be taken to be located at the top of the acceleration region in order to fulfill the Davisson condition. This may limit the effective magnetic mirror ratio, such that the applicability of the linear approximation to the current–voltage characteristic is more restricted, and the saturation current is moderately small, which may lead to overvoltages, a redistribution of the current, or an increased extent of the acceleration region. Joining solutions that piecewise fulfill the Davisson condition, we can derive the current flow for a rather wide range of prescribed potential distributions. Earlier works on the Knight mechanism and related theories for determining the voltage drop along a flux tube are discussed. Determination of the electrostatic potential distribution, and verification of the Davisson condition, requires considerations of the space charge (Poisson equation), to be discussed in a second paper.},

abstract = {The distribution of current-driven electrostatic potentials along auroral magnetospheric flux tubes is studied analytically, based on the principles of quasi-neutrality and kinetic orbital motion of electrons and ions governed by inertia, electric forces, and magnetic mirror forces. When certain particle accessibility conditions are fulfilled, the kinetics determines the electron and ion number densities as unique functions of position along the flux tube and local potential. These functions are used to define potential profiles for which electron and ion number densities everywhere match, or alternatively positions where potential jumps (double layers) may occur. Magnetospheric and ionospheric particle sources in the form of Maxwellians with loss cones depending on the total voltage drop are considered, as well as trapped particles. The potential profile generally comprises a potential jump that accounts for a sizeable fraction of the total voltage drop (only by assuming unrealistic velocity distributions of the magnetospheric electron source can solutions without a jump be found). The jump may typically occur around an altitude of 1 RE, an altitude that increases with density of the ionospheric source and that decreases with increasing density of trapped, secondary, and backscattered particles and total voltage drop along the flux tube. Below the potential jump, only small potential variations occur. Above the potential jump, the potential falls off gradually, asymptotically linear in magnetic field intensity. Only a small percentage of the potential drop occurs above an altitude of a few RE, but the weak field extending to higher altitudes is essential for quasi-neutrality and for the current-voltage relationship (discussed in a previous paper). Above the potential jump, the number density of particles is reduced as compared to regions without current flow and potential drops. Depending on the density of the ionospheric source, solutions are possible for total potential drops much larger than the temperature of the magnetospheric electron source. While full accessibility for the mirroring electrons tends to be locally violated, accessibility for all particles within the source cone is fulfilled in these solutions, so the current-voltage relationship does not depend on the shape of the potential profile. Some comments are also made on transient conditions when there is no time for transport of neutralizing ions from the ionosphere.},

abstract = {An algorithm is presented for predicting the ground-based Dst index solely from a knowledge of the velocity and density of the solar wind and the north-south solar magnetospheric component of the interplanetary magnetic field. The three key elements of this model are an adjustment for solar wind dynamic pressure, an injection rate linearly proportional to the dawn-to-dusk component of the interplanetary electric field which is zero for electric fields below 0.5 mV m−1, and an exponential decay rate of the ring current with an e folding time of 7.7 hours. The algorithm is used to predict the Dst signature of seven geomagnetic storm intervals in 1967 and 1968. In addition to being quite successful, considering the simplicity of the model, the algorithm pinpoints the causes of various types of storm behavior. A main phase is initiated whenever the dawn-to-dusk solar magnetospheric component of the interplanetary electric field becomes large and positive. It is preceded by an initial phase of increased Dst if the solar wind dynamic pressure increases suddenly prior to the main phase. The recovery phase is initiated when the injection rate governed by the interplanetary electric field drops below the ring current decay rate associated with the ring current strength built up during the main phase. Variable recovery rates are generally due to additional injection during the recovery phase. This one algorithm accounts for magnetospheric behavior at quiet and at disturbed times and seems capable of predicting the behavior of Dst during even the largest of storms.},

abstract = {The ion and electron plasma experiment on the Fast Auroral Snapshot satellite (FAST) is designed to measure pitch-angle distributions of suprathermal auroral electrons and ions with high sensitivity, wide dynamic range, good energy and angular resolution, and exceptional time resolution. These measurements support the primary scientific goal of the FAST mission to understand the physical processes responsible for auroral particle acceleration and heating, and associated wave-particle interactions. The instrument includes a complement of 8 pairs of `Top Hat' electrostatic analyzer heads with microchannel plate (MCP) electron multipliers and discrete anodes to provide angle resolved measurements. The analyzers are packaged in four instrument stacks, each containing four analyzers. These four stacks are equally spaced around the spacecraft spin plane. Analyzers mounted on opposite sides of the spacecraft operate in pairs such that their individual 180{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}} fields of view combine to give an unobstructed 360{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}} field of view in the spin plane. The earth's magnetic field is within a few degrees of the spin plane during most auroral crossings, so the time resolution for pitch-angle distribution measurements is independent of the spacecraft spin period. Two analyzer pairs serve as electron and ion spectrometers that obtain distributions of 48 energies at 32 angles every 78 ms. Their standard energy ranges are 4 eV to 32 keV for electrons and 3 eV to 24 keV for ions. These sensors also have deflection plates that can track the magnetic field direction within 10{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}} of the spin plane to resolve narrow, magnetic field-aligned beams of electrons and ions. The remaining six analyzer pairs collectively function as an electron spectrograph, resolving distributions with 16 contiguous pitch-angle bins and a selectable trade-off of energy and time resolution. Two examples of possible operating modes are a maximum time resolution mode with 16 angles and 6 energies every 1.63 ms, or a maximum energy resolution mode with 16 angles and 48 energies every 13 ms. The instrument electronics include mcp pulse amplifiers and counters, high voltage supplies, command/data interface circuits, and diagnostic test circuits. All data formatting, commanding, timing and operational control of the plasma analyzer instrument are managed by a central instrument data processing unit (IDPU), which controls all of the FAST science instruments. The IDPU creates slower data modes by averaging the high rate measurements collected on the spacecraft. A flexible combination of burst mode data and slower `survey' data are defined by IDPU software tables that can be revised by command uploads. Initial flight results demonstrate successful achievement of all measurement objectives.},

Large impulsive electric and magnetic field deviations on the boundary between the auroral oval and the polar cap close to magnetic midnight are correlated with accelerated electrons and excite semi periodic oscillations with a frequency of ∼0.5 Hz. Linear one-dimensional simulations of the Alfven resonator including parallel electric fields due to electron inertial effects, the ionospheric feedback instability and statistically determined altitude dependent density and composition profiles in a dipole geomagnetic field yield waveforms and electron energy spectra qualitatively similar to observations. However, from comparison with a case study example observed above a sunlit ionosphere, the observed electron energies (which exceed 10 keV) suggest that the observed wave carries a parallel electric field larger than possible from electron inertial effects in the linear approximation particularly if this acceleration occurs at altitudes within the ionospheric Alfven resonator.},

We show that the energy transport through the cascade is sufficient to drive the observed acceleration of electrons from near-Earth space to form the aurora. We find that regions of Alfv{\'{e}}n wave dissipation, and particle acceleration, are localized or intermittent and embedded within a near-homogeneous background of large-scale MHD structures.},

abstract = {A prominent yet largely unrecognized feature of the innermagnetosphere associated with particle injections, and more generally geomagnetic storms, is the occurrence of broadband electromagnetic field fluctuations over spacecraft frame frequencies (fsc) extending from effectively zero to fsc≳100 Hz. Using observations from the Van Allen Probes we showthat these wavesmost commonly occur premidnight but are observed over a range of local times extending into the daysidemagnetosphere.We find that the variation of magnetic spectral energy density with fsc obeys $\epsilon$B ¼ Af?$\alpha$ sc over several decades with a spectral breakpoint at fb≈1Hz. The values for $\alpha$ are lognormally distributed with $\alpha$=1.9±0.6 for fsc{\textless}fb and $\alpha$=2.9±0.6 for fsc{\textgreater}fb. A is a function of geomagnetic activity with the largest values observed over intervals of decreasing Dst index during the main phase of geomagnetic storms. At these times these waves are nearly always present in the nightside inner magnetosphere and are commonly observed from L=3 outward. The observed variation of the electric tomagnetic field amplitude with fsc is well described by a dispersive Alfv{\'{e}}n wavemodel under the assumption that fsc is primarily a consequence of the Doppler shift of plasma frame structuresmoving over the spacecraft. The robust anticorrelation between the time rate change of the Dst index and wave spectral energy density coupled with the ability of dispersive Alfv{\'{e}}n waves to drive transverse ion acceleration suggests that these waves may boost ion energy density in the inner magnetosphere and intensify the ring current during storm times},

abstract = {We have examined the propagation of sudden impulses (SI) by an MHD numerical simulation in the three-dimensional magnetosphere to assess the precision of the Tamao travel time approximation and the dynamic properties of preliminary impulses (PI). The results show that the propagation of SI signals is strongly influenced by the inhomogeneous Alfv{\'{e}}n velocity profile, and the region of high Alfv{\'{e}}n velocity immediately outside the plasmasphere allows the signals to reach ionospheric altitudes in the shortest time possible. At the ionospheric altitude, the simulated arrival time of the PI, defined by the first peak in wave amplitude, is in extremely good agreement with Tamao's prediction throughout the range of invariant latitudes connected to the outer magnetosphere. The arrival time at invariant latitudes within the plasmasphere, however, is slightly earlier than Tamao's prediction because of the fact that the impulse deviates from a point source as it arrives at the plasmapause. In contrast, the onset time of the PI, which corresponds to the first deflection in the magnetic field, varies little with invariant latitude, consistent with the well-established observations of the nearly simultaneous PI onset without the need to invoke the Earth-ionosphere waveguide model. Our simulation also shows that the differentiation in PI arrival time strongly influences the evolution of the ionospheric convection vortices. The twin vortices first appear slightly above the latitude connected to the plasmapause, and they move poleward because of the late arrival of impulse signals at higher latitudes. Another pair of vortices appears later at plasmaspheric latitudes owing to the delay of signals by the dense plasmasphere. Our results not only provide quantitative assessment on the Tamao path, which can benefit future development in travel time magnetoseismology, but they also demonstrate the evolution of PI-induced ionospheric convection vortices by incorporating the propagation characteristics of MHD waves.},

abstract = {We report on a coordinated set of observations from Greenland magnetometers, Sondrestrom incoherent scatter radar, DMSP F9 and F10 satellite data, and IMP 8 measurements of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and solar wind plasma. These data were acquired during an interval (August 4, 1991, 1100 - 1400 UT) which is characterized by magnetic ULF pulsations observed on the ground which occur in a limited band between 73° and 78° magnetic latitude. The spatial characteristics of the ground ULF magnetic pulsation disturbances are consistent with a continuous train of ionospheric convection vortices moving westward across local magnetic noon sector with a phase velocity of 1.3 km/s. The vortices occur at the ionospheric convection reversal boundary. Defense Meterological Satellite Program (DMSP) drift meter data are consistent with the incoherent scatter convection measurements, and DMSP particle data indicate that the ionospheric reversal boundary maps to the low-latitude boundary. Using magnetometer stations across Greenland from the east coast, central Greenland, and the west coast, we can determine that individual vortices are long lived, lasting over 15 min. Cross correlations of the pulsation wave forms at stations separated longitudinally by about 500 km produce coefficients between 0.65 and 0.75. Cross correlations between stations separated longitudinally by 1000 km produce coefficients of only 0.39. This indicates that while individual vortices are long lived, they are evolving significantly in shape, latitudinal location, and intensity, as they move distances of 1000 km across the ionosphere. Using a field-aligned current filament model to fit the data, we find the strength (50 to 100 kA) of these currents to be larger than typical currents previously reported. We find solar wind pressure variations an unlikely source for the generation of these pulsations and suggest that they are the ionospheric signature of either a Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism or perhaps magnetic merging during an interval of IMF oriented predominantly in the By direction.},

@article{Cowley1981,
abstract = {The origin of magnetospheric asymmetry effects associated with the equatorial plane component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is discussed in terms of the forces exerted on open flux tubes mapping into the solar wind. It is argued that the downstream relaxation of the magnetosphere under the action of these stresses towards a state of reduced stress is such as to allow, in effect, partial penetration of this field component (both Bx and By in magnetospheric coordinates) into the magnetosphere. Many of the associated phenomena are therefore qualitatively described by the ‘dipole plus uniform IMF' model, since this represents the idealization of exactly zero electromagnetic stress and hence gives a lowest order picture of the effects which result from magnetospheric relaxation toward that state. This is true of IMF By-associated effects which are well documented experimentally and which form a rich and consistent set of phenomena which have received considerable attention over the past decade. It is argued here that exactly corresponding phenomena are expected to be associated with the IMF Bx field as well, but because of the differing field direction these will take differing and usually less obvious forms than the similar effects associated with By. The suggested partial penetration of the IMF Bx field should be directly testable in the dipolar field region of the magnetosphere, but in the tail North-South displacements of the current sheet (and possibly magnetopause) are expected to occur instead. Some evidence of the latter displacements are presented. The other major IMF Bx effect should be noon-midnight displacements of the polar cap, such as have been recently reported. Little IMF Bx effect on auroral zone flows is anticipated, by contrast with the dawn-dusk asymmetries in this flow associated with IMF By.},

abstract = {Geometrical considerations are presented to show that dayside magnetic merging when constrained to act only where the fields are antiparallel results in lines of merging that converge at the polar cusps. An important consequence of this geometry is that no accelerated flows are predicted across the dayside magnetopause. Acceleration owing to merging acts in opposition to the magnetosheath flow at the merging point and produces the variably directed, slower-than-magnetosheath flows observed in the entry layer. Another consequence of the merging geometry is that much of the time closed field lines constitute the subsolar region of the magnetopause. The manner in which the polar cap convection patterns predicted by the proposed geometry change as the interplanetary field is rotated through 360° provides a unifying description of how the observed single circular vortex and the crescent-shaped double vortex patterns mutually evolve under the influence of a single operating principle. },

However, in the summer hemisphere, when IMF By is strongly positive, the dusk cell so dominates the dawn cell that the latter nearly disappears; and when IMF By is strongly negative, the cells are most nearly equal. The difference between winter and summer can be explained by the addition in summer of a single lobe cell, that is, a cell confined to open field lines, circulating within the dusk cell of the two-cell pattern when By is positive and within the dawn cell when By is negative. The result is consistent with predictions of the overdraped lobe model, that lobe cells occur in only one hemisphere at a time, and that their occurrence is controlled by dipole tilt.},

@article{Davis1997,
abstract = {Superposed epoch studies have been carried out in order to determine the ionospheric response at mid-latitudes to southward turnings of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). This is compared with the geomagnetic response, as seen in the indices Kp, AE and Dst. The solar wind, IMF and geomagnetic data used were hourly averages from the years 1967--1989 and thus cover a full 22-year cycle in the solar magnetic field. These data were divided into subsets, determined by the magnitudes of the southward turnings and the concomitant increase in solar wind pressure. The superposed epoch studies were carried out using the time of the southward turning as time zero. The response of the mid-latitude ionosphere is studied by looking at the F-layer critical frequencies, foF2, from hourly soundings by the Slough ionosonde and their deviation from the monthly median values, {\$}\delta{\$}foF2. For the southward turnings with a change in B z of {\$}\delta{\$}B z {\textgreater} 11.5 nT accompanied by a solar wind dynamic pressure P exceeding 5 nPa, the F region critical frequency, foF2, shows a marked decrease, reaching a minimum value about 20 h after the southward turning. This recovers to pre-event values over the subsequent 24 h, on average. The Dst index shows the classic storm-time decrease to about −60 nT. Four days later, the index has still to fully recover and is at about −25 nT. Both the Kp and AE indices show rises before the southward turnings, when the IMF is strongly northward but the solar wind dynamic pressure is enhanced. The average AE index does register a clear isolated pulse (averaging 650 nT for 2 h, compared with a background peak level of near 450 nT at these times) showing enhanced energy deposition at high latitudes in substorms but, like Kp, remains somewhat enhanced for several days, even after the average IMF has returned to zero after 1 day. This AE background decays away over several days as the Dst index recovers, indicating that there is some contamination of the currents observed at the AE stations by the continuing enhanced equatorial ring current. For data averaged over all seasons, the critical frequencies are depressed at Slough by 1.3 MHz, which is close to the lower decile of the overall distribution of {\$}\delta{\$}foFl values. Taking 30-day periods around summer and winter solstice, the largest depression is 1.6 and 1.2 MHz, respectively. This seasonal dependence is confirmed by a similar study for a Southern Hemisphere station, Argentine Island, giving peak depressions of 1.8 MHz and 0.5 MHz for summer and winter. For the subset of turnings where {\$}\delta{\$}B z {\textgreater} 11.5 nT and P ≤ 5 nPa, the response of the geomagnetic indices is similar but smaller, while the change in {\$}\delta{\$}foF2 has all but disappeared. This confirms that the energy deposited at high latitudes, which leads to the geomagnetic and ionospheric disturbances following a southward turning of the IMF, increases with the energy density (dynamic pressure) of the solar wind flow. The magnitude of all responses are shown to depend on {\$}\delta{\$}B z . At Slough, the peak depression always occurs when Slough rotates into the noon sector. The largest ionospheric response is for southward turnings seen between 15--21 UT.},

abstract = {Utilizing FAST satellite electron measurements, we present the first reported investigation of the dependency on latitude of quasi-static structure (“inverted-V”) potential drop magnitude ($\Phi$). A trend of lower $\Phi$ at lower latitudes in the premidnight sector on field lines with dark foot points was observed. This trend is supported both statistically and in individual satellite crossings. The existence of two distinct peaks in occurrence probability for $\Phi$ was also observed: one between {\~{}}2 kV and 10 kV and the other at somewhat less than 1 kV. The relative occurrence of structures with $\Phi$ in the higher ({\textgreater}2 kV) peak is significantly reduced with decreasing latitude. This partially accounts for the statistical trend of lower potential drop magnitudes at lower latitudes. The two $\Phi$ occurrence frequency peaks correspond to two different regimes (one with e$\Phi$/kTe {\~{}} or {\textgreater} 1 and one with e$\Phi$/kTe {\textless} 1). In the lower $\Phi$ ({\textless}1 kV, e$\Phi$/kTe {\textless} {\~{}}1) regime which constitutes the vast majority of midlatitude events, these results are consistent with a voltage source configuration or more complex current-voltage relation where source electron density rather than $\Phi$ is most directly controlled by the field-aligned current density. These observations and their ramifications represent a significant step forward in the understanding of field-aligned currents, auroral acceleration, and magnetospheric-ionospheric coupling.},

abstract = {An isolated burst of 0.35 Hz electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves was observed at four sites on Svalbard from 0947 to 0954 UT 2 January 2011, roughly 1 h after local noon. This burst was associated with one of a series of {\~{}}50 nT magnetic impulses observed at the northernmost stations of the IMAGE magnetometer array. Hankasalmi SuperDARN radar data showed a west-to-east (antisunward) propagating vortical ionospheric flow in a region of high spectral width {\~{}} 1–2° north of Svalbard, confirming that this magnetic impulse was the signature of a traveling convection vortex. Ground-based observations of the H$\alpha$ line at Longyearbyen indicated proton precipitation at the same time as the EMIC wave burst, and NOAA-19, which passed over the west coast of Svalbard between 0951 and 0952, observed a clear enhancement of ring current protons at the same latitude. Electron precipitation from this same satellite indicated that the EMIC burst was located on closed field lines, but near to the polar cap boundary. We believe these are the first simultaneous observations of EMIC waves and precipitating energetic protons so near to the boundary of the dayside magnetosphere. Although several spacecraft upstream of Earth observed a steady solar wind and predominantly radial interplanetary magnetic field orientation before and during this event, data from Geotail (near the morning bow shock) showed large reorientations of the interplanetary magnetic field and substantial decreases in ion density several minutes before it, and data from Cluster (near the afternoon bow shock) showed an outward excursion of the bow shock simultaneous with it. These upstream perturbations suggest that a spontaneous hot flow anomaly, a bow shock related instability, may have been responsible for triggering this event, but do not provide enough information to fully characterize that instability.},

abstract = {We present a case and statistical study of plasma convection in the Northern Hemisphere during summer conditions using electric field, magnetic field, and particle data taken during dawn-dusk directed orbits of the FAST satellite. To our knowledge, this set provides the most comprehensive combination of data as yet presented in support of lobe cell convection from an ionospheric perspective this far from the noon sector. In particular, we study the current systems and convection patterns for all passes in July 1997 that show evidence for six large-scale field-aligned currents (FACs) rather than the usual system of four FACs associated with the region 1/region 2 current systems. A total of 71 passes out of 232 in the study had the extra pair of FACs. The extra pair of FACs in 30 of the 71 cases lies either on the dawnside or on the duskside of the noon-midnight meridian, and their position is strongly correlated with the polarity of the IMF By (negative and positive, respectively). This is consistent with the IMF dependence of a three-cell convection pattern of coexisting merging, viscous, and lobe-type convection cells. The occurrence of the asymmetric FAC pair was also strongly linked to conditions of IMF |By/Bz| {\textgreater} 1. The extra pair of FACs in these cases was clearly associated with the lobe cell of the three-cell convection system. The remaining 41 cases had the pair of FACs straddling the noon-midnight meridian. The extra pair of FACs was often (20 cases out of 30) observed at magnetic local times more than three hours away from noon, rather than being confined to regions near noon and the typical location of the cusp. Such a current system consisting of a pair of FACs poleward of the nearest region 1 current is consistent with the IMF By-dependent global MHD model developed by Ogino et al. [1986] for southward IMF conditions, as well as with other magnetospheric and ionospheric convection models that include the effects of merging occuring simultaneously at both low-latitude dayside and high-latitude lobe and flank magnetopause reconnection sites. Finally, the presence of the additional FACs and three-cell convection well away from noon show that the entire dayside ionosphere is affected by IMF-dependent processes, rather than only a limited region around noon.},

abstract = {The Geotail spacecraft made an inbound passage perpendicular to the dusk equatorial magnetopause on 1 August 1998 when the interplanetary magnetic field had been very northward for more than 10 hours. As the spacecraft moved through the low-latitude boundary layer, it detected waves with ∼3 min period that caused transitions between cool dense magnetosheath plasma and mixed magnetosheath and magnetosphere plasmas. A region of highly fluctuating magnetic fields with variations up to 50 nT/s was observed on leaving the magnetosheath plasma but not on its return to this region. This observation suggests that the boundary region is not laminar but more likely consists of Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices. Such fluctuations are probably caused by twisting of the field by the vortices, and they could be important in transporting plasma to the magnetosphere where densities of 5/cc were observed. A global MHD simulation of the event reproduced the observed low-frequency waves, their counterclockwise polarization, and a region of high-velocity magnetosheath flow outside the magnetopause. This flow was associated with a decreased density and increased field strength which are characteristics of a plasma depletion layer. When Geotail moved further inward into the magnetosphere, it detected waves that are probably the magnetotail vortices which had been detected earlier by the ISEE spacecraft.},

abstract = {We present an example of a boundary layer tailward of the dawn terminator which is entirely populated by rolled-up flow vortices. Observations were made by Wind on 24 October 2001 as the spacecraft moved across the region at X ∼−13 RE. Interplanetary conditions were steady with a near-radial interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Approximately 15 vortices were observed over the 1.5 h duration of Wind's crossing, each lasting ∼5 min. The rolling up is inferred from the presence of a hot tenuous plasma being accelerated to speeds higher than in the adjoining magnetosheath, a circumstance which has been shown to be a reliable signature of this in single-spacecraft observations. A blob of cold dense plasma was entrained in each vortex, at whose leading edge abrupt polarity changes of field and velocity components at current sheets were regularly observed. In the frame of the average boundary layer velocity, the dense blobs were moving predominantly sunward and their scale size along X was ∼7.4 RE. Inquiring into the generation mechanism of the vortices, we analyze the stability of the boundary layer to sheared flows using compressible magnetohydrodynamic Kelvin-Helmholtz theory with continuous profiles for the physical quantities. We input parameters from (i) the exact theory of magnetosheath flow under aligned solar wind field and flow vectors near the terminator and (ii) the Wind data. It is shown that the configuration is indeed Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) unstable. This is the first reported example of KH-unstable waves at the magnetopause under a radial IMF.},

A plasma depletion layer forms at Mercury as a result of piled-up magnetic flux that is draped around the magnetosphere. The low average upstream Alfv{\'{e}}nic Mach number (MA {\~{}}3–5) in the solar wind at Mercury often results in large-scale plasma depletion in the magnetosheath between the subsolar magnetopause and the bow shock. Flux pileup is observed to occur downstream under both quasi-perpendicular and quasi-parallel shock geometries for all orientations of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Furthermore, little to no plasma depletion is seen during some periods with stable northward IMF. The consistently low value of plasma $\beta$, the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure, at the magnetopause associated with the low average upstream MA is believed to be the cause for the high average reconnection rate at Mercury, reported to be nearly 3 times that observed at Earth. Finally, a characteristic depletion length outward from the subsolar magnetopause of {\~{}}300 km is found for Mercury. This value scales among planetary bodies as the average standoff distance of the magnetopause.},

abstract = {Instrumentation that detects individual plasma particles is susceptible to random counting errors. These errors propagate into the calculations of moments of measured particle velocity distribution functions. Although rules of thumb exist for the effects of random errors on the calculation of lower order moments (e.g., density, velocity, and temperature) of Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, they do not generally apply to nonthermal distributions or to higher-order moments. To date, such errors have only been estimated using brute force Monte Carlo techniques, i.e., repeated ({\~{}}50) samplings of distribution functions. Here we present a mathematical formalism for analytically obtaining uncertainty estimates of plasma moments due to random errors either measured in situ by instruments or synthesized by particle simulations. Our uncertainty estimates precisely match the statistical variation of simulated plasma moments and carry the computational cost equivalent of only {\~{}}15 Monte Carlo samplings. In addition, we provide the means to calculate a covariance matrix that can be reported along with typical plasma moments. This matrix enables the propagation of statistical errors into arbitrary coordinate systems or functions of plasma moments without the need to reanalyze full distribution functions. Our methodology, which is applied to electron data from Plasma Electron and Current Experiment on the Cluster spacecraft as an example, is relevant to both existing and future data sets and requires only instrument-measured counts and phase space densities reported for a set of calibrated energy-angle targets.},

abstract = {Two periods during which the convection boundary was in the Scandinavian Twin Auroral Radar Experiment field of view a few hours before and after magnetic noon are analyzed. We find that sporadic and spatially isolated flow across the convection boundary occurs on time scales of a few minutes and in regions which in the ionosphere range in size from 50 km to 300 km. We suggest that the antisunward flow immediately north of the convection boundary maps into the low-latitude boundary layer. Our observations then indicate that the magnetic flux in the boundary layer is transported outward. We estimate a typical flux transfer rate of 2.5×104 Wb s−1 for one flux transfer event. On one occasion, GEOS 2 observes a rapid simultaneous dropout of energetic ions and electrons inside the magnetopause. This dropout is associated with a ground E × B signature of strong northwesterly flow. We believe that this constitutes good evidence for the occurrence of flux transfer from closed to open field lines.},

abstract = {The relationship between interplanetary magnetic fields seen by the Ames magnetometer on board Explorer 33 and surface magnetic variations has been studied. The emphasis of the study is toward achieving a unified view of all the experimental results, both of this study and previous studies. Various statistical studies of the relationship between Kp and parameters of the solar wind were carried out. The effect of the direction of the z component of the interplanetary field is confirmed. In all other statistical studies the data were divided into two groups, one in which the 3-hr average field pointed northward, and the other in which it pointed southward. In this way, we show, for example, that the tendency toward an association of high Kp with intense interplanetary fields is independent of the North-South effect. Other statistical investigations were also carried out. The Sun was considerably disturbed during the period covered by this study, giving an excellent opportunity to observe the magnetic configuration of flare-induced interplanetary storms and their relation to geomagnetic storms. The interplanetary storm was found to be typified by persistent, strong fields (up to 30 $\gamma$) that rise far out of the ecliptic plane. As discussed below, this is to be expected on the basis of simple models. Further, it was found that high-velocity plasma and intense, highly disturbed interplanetary fields are also typical of interplanetary storms. The close association of these parameters in the interplanetary medium is one cause of confusion in interpretations of geomagnetic studies. During the flare-produced storm of February 15, 1967, there was a remarkably close temporal association between events in space and on the surface. This event is discussed in detail.},

We find that the ions preferentially feed the dusk sector of the plasma sheet when the IMF is duskward (By{\textgreater}0), and are more evenly distributed in the plasma sheet when the IMF is dawnward. The flow of oxygen ions originating from the noon or dusk sectors of the polar cap has a higher probability of reaching the magnetosphere and beyond compared with that from the dawn or midnight sectors, due to the increased centrifugal acceleration associated with the larger magnetic field curvature near noon and the increased convection electric field in the dusk sector. The flow is enhanced and confined to lower L-shells at times of strongly southward IMF, compared with that at times of northward IMF. The outflow rate to both the plasma sheet and the magnetotail correlates strongly with the ion temperature. As a result, the IMF and the convection electric fields affect both the overall magnitude and the detailed distribution of mass transfer from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere in magnetosphere–ionosphere coupling.},

The authors organize the chapter in terms of proposed mechanisms capable of linking outer boundary waves (upstream bow shock-origin or magnetopause oscillations) to inner magnetospheric waves: global modes; KH waves/vortices; solar wind or bow-shock-origin perturbations; and reconnection/FTE-driven processes. As in the case of cavity and waveguide modes discussed in the chapter, the detection of KH-driven global mode and its coupling to FLRs is rather evasive due to the difficulty in separating various internal and external FLR triggers, together with the difficulty in correctly determining fundamental frequencies. The chapter explains how low-frequency waves processed by the bow shock or generated in the magnetosheath impact the magnetopause and the inner magnetosphere.},

While the THEMIS A, C, D, and E observations allowed the determination of the velocity, size, and shape of a large bulge moving tailward along the magnetopause at a speed of 355 km/s, THEMIS B observed the signatures of a hot flow anomaly (HFA) upstream of the bow shock at the same time, indicating that the pressure perturbation generated by the HFA may be the source of the fast compression and expansion of the magnetosphere. The transient deformation of the magnetopause generated field-aligned currents and created traveling convection vortices which were detected by ground magnetometers. This event demonstrates that kinetic (non-MHD) effects at the bow shock can have global consequences on the magnetosphere.},

abstract = {We present observations of electrons and ions that have been affected by an auroral plasma acceleration mechanism. In the nine events studied, nearly simultaneous and magnetically conjugate measurements were made by instruments on the Fast Auroral Snapshot (FAST) and Polar satellites (1900–4100 and 20000–37000 km altitude ranges, respectively). FAST sees inverted-V-type electron spectra in five out of nine events, in the remaining four events the precipitation seen at FAST is diffuse rather than inverted-V-type. In those inverted-V cases where the electron distribution at Polar is quasi-Maxwellian (two events), assuming a potential drop of appropriate magnitude between the two spacecraft can well explain the spectra. In more complicated non-Maxwellian cases (three events), a net potential drop between FAST and Polar could explain the total FAST energy flux rather well, but it fails to explain the details of the distribution functions. Thus the “standard” explanation of inverted-V-type electron spectra in terms of potential drop acceleration may work in the quasi-Maxwellian events (which represent the small-energy end of inverted-V spectra, with 1–2 keV energies) but not in the non-Maxwellian events. Measurements of the upward flowing ionospheric ions at Polar also support this view. In the non-Maxwellian events, sporadic very broadband electrostatic wave activity (4–1000 Hz frequency range) temporally correlates well with field-aligned acceleration of the cold (but not the hot) electron population.},

abstract = {This paper attempts to summarize the current understanding of the storm/substorm relationship by clearing up a considerable amount of controversy and by addressing the question of how solar wind energy is deposited into and is dissipated in the constituent elements that are critical to magnetospheric and ionospheric processes during magnetic storms. (1) Four mechanisms are identified and discussed as the primary causes of enhanced electric fields in the interplanetary medium responsible for geomagnetic storms. It is pointed out that in reality, these four mechanisms, which are not mutually exclusive, but interdependent, interact differently from event to event. Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and corotating interaction regions (CIRs) are found to be the primary phenomena responsible for the main phase of geomagnetic storms. The other two mechanisms, i.e., HILDCAA (high-intensity, long-duration, continuous auroral electrojet activity) and the so-called Russell-McPherron effect, work to make the ICME and CIR phenomena more geoeffective. The solar cycle dependence of the various sources in creating magnetic storms has yet to be quantitatively understood. (2) A serious controversy exists as to whether the successive occurrence of intense substorms plays a direct role in the energization of ring current particles or whether the enhanced electric field associated with southward IMF enhances the effect of substorm expansions. While most of the Dst variance during magnetic storms can be solely reproduced by changes in the large-scale electric field in the solar wind and the residuals are uncorrelated with substorms, recent satellite observations of the ring current constituents during the main phase of magnetic storms show the importance of ionospheric ions. This implies that ionospheric ions, which are associated with the frequent occurrence of intense substorms, are accelerated upward along magnetic field lines, contributing to the energy density of the storm-time ring current. An apparently new controversy regarding the relative importance of the two processes is thus created. It is important to identify the role of substorm occurrence in the large-scale enhancement of magnetospheric convection driven by solar wind electric fields. (3) Numerical schemes for predicting geomagnetic activity indices on the basis of solar/solar wind/interplanetary magnetic field parameters continue to be upgraded, ensuring reliable techniques for forecasting magnetic storms under real-time conditions. There is a need to evaluate the prediction capability of geomagnetic indices on the basis of physical processes that occur during storm time substorms. (4) It is crucial to differentiate between storms and nonstorm time substorms in terms of energy transfer/conversion processes, i.e., mechanical energy from the solar wind, electromagnetic energy in the magnetotail, and again, mechanical energy of particles in the plasma sheet, ring current, and aurora. To help answer the question of the role of substorms in energizing ring current particles, it is crucial to find efficient magnetospheric processes that heat ions up to some minimal energies so that they can have an effect on the strength of the storm time ring current. (5) The question of whether the Dst index is an accurate and effective measure of the storm time ring current is also controversial. In particular, it is demonstrated that the dipolarization effect associated with substorm expansion acts to reduce the Dst magnitude, even though the ring current may still be growing.},

abstract = {We have compiled a complete list of magnetic impulse events (MIEs) during the 8-year period of 1995–2002 covering solar minimum to solar maximum using fluxgate magnetometer data obtained at the South Pole. Wavelet analysis enables us to detect 825 distinct MIEs automatically with high confidence. Interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) discontinuities are also detected automatically for the same period from Wind and ACE satellite data. From an examination and comparison of the two lists, we find that monthly and seasonal variations in IMF discontinuity occurrences have a significant correlation (0.4–0.5) with those of MIEs. We also find that MIEs tend to occur during intervals of low density, high-speed solar wind streams, and/or radial IMF. No preferences for MIE occurrences are found for solar wind pressure jumps or IMF Bz southward turnings. From detailed minimum variance analysis of 36 IMF discontinuities with one-to-one correspondence to MIEs, ∼70{\%} of the IMF discontinuities are found to be tangential discontinuities. The hot flow anomaly (HFA) mechanism can explain at most ∼50{\%} of the MIEs; bursty reconnection and pressure pulses can explain the production of at most ∼30{\%} and ∼20{\%} of the MIEs, respectively. All of the observations and associations are consistent with HFAs or foreshock cavities being the main cause of MIEs.},

abstract = {Magnetic reconnection is believed to be the dominant process by which solar wind plasma enters the magnetosphere. However, for periods of northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) reconnection is less likely at the dayside magnetopause, and Kelvin-Helmholtz waves (KHWs) may be important agents for plasma entry and for the excitation of ultra-low-frequency (ULF) waves. The relative importance of KHWs is controversial because no statistical data on their occurrence frequency exist. Here we survey 7 years of in situ data from the NASA THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macro scale Interactions during Substorms) mission and find that KHWs occur at the magnetopause [sim]19{\%} of the time. The rate increases with solar wind speed, Alfven Mach number and number density, but is mostly independent of IMF magnitude. KHWs may thus be more important for plasma transport across the magnetopause than previously thought, and frequently drive magnetospheric ULF waves.},

However, we have found evidence for global contributions from electromagnetic waves (Alfv{\'{e}}n waves). Data that were collected from the Polar spacecraft over the course of 1 year show that the flow of wave electromagnetic energy at altitudes of 25,000 to 38,000 kilometers delineates the statistical auroral oval. The Poynting flux of individual events distributed along the auroral oval was larger than 5 ergs per square centimeter per second, which is sufficient to power auroral acceleration processes. This evidence suggests that in addition to magnetic field-aligned currents, the dayside and nightside aurora is globally powered by the energy flow of these high-altitude Alfv{\'{e}}n waves.},

abstract = {Precipitating auroral electrons can produce discrete auroral arcs that contain signatures of the magnetospheric auroral source region. Differential number flux observations over two discrete aurorae were obtained by the Auroral Currents and Electrodynamics Structure sounding rocket mission, which successfully launched in 2009. These observations were made at E region altitudes of approximately 130 km. A model of precipitating auroral electrons as described by Evans (1974) was fit to the electron differential number flux obtained by the payloads, and parameters from the model were used to infer properties of the auroral source region. It is shown that the field-aligned precipitating electrons were better fit by a kappa distribution function versus a Maxwellian distribution function for the equatorward side of the first, quasi-stable, auroral arc crossing. The latter half of the first auroral arc crossing and second auroral crossing show that the precipitating electrons were better fit by a Maxwellian distribution function, which provides additional observational confirmation of previous studies. The low-energy electron population determined by the Evans (1974) model was within a factor of 2 of the observed differential number flux. The source region parameters determined from fitting the model to the data were compared with relevant studies from sounding rockets and satellites. Our observations are consistent with the results of Kletzing et al. (2003) that the plasma sheet electrons mapping to auroral zone invariant latitudes are characterized by kappa distribution functions.},

abstract = {The precipitation of high-energy magnetospheric electrons (E ∼ 600 eV–10 KeV) in the diffuse aurora contributes significant energy flux into the Earth's ionosphere. To fully understand the formation of this flux at the upper ionospheric boundary, ∼700–800 km, it is important to consider the coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere system. In the diffuse aurora, precipitating electrons initially injected from the plasma sheet via wave-particle interaction processes degrade in the atmosphere toward lower energies and produce secondary electrons via impact ionization of the neutral atmosphere. These precipitating electrons can be additionally reflected upward from the two conjugate ionospheres, leading to a series of multiple reflections through the magnetosphere. These reflections greatly influence the initially precipitating flux at the upper ionospheric boundary (700–800 km) and the resultant population of secondary electrons and electrons cascading toward lower energies. In this paper, we present the solution of the Boltzman-Landau kinetic equation that uniformly describes the entire electron distribution function in the diffuse aurora, including the affiliated production of secondary electrons (E {\textless} 600 eV) and its energy interplay in the magnetosphere and two conjugated ionospheres. This solution takes into account, for the first time, the formation of the electron distribution function in the diffuse auroral region, beginning with the primary injection of plasma sheet electrons via both electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic waves and whistler mode chorus waves to the loss cone, and including their subsequent multiple atmospheric reflections in the two magnetically conjugated ionospheres. It is demonstrated that magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is key in forming the electron distribution function in the diffuse auroral region.},

Interaction of these superthermal electrons with the neutral atmosphere leads to the production of secondary electrons (E {\textless} 500–600 eV) and, as a result, leads to the activation of lower energy superthermal electron spectra that can escape back to the magnetosphere and contribute to the thermal electron energy deposition processes in the magnetospheric plasma. The ECH and whistler mode chorus waves, however, can also interact with the secondary electrons that are coming from both of the magnetically conjugated ionospheres after they have been produced by initially precipitated high-energy electrons that came from the plasma sheet. After their degradation and subsequent reflection in magnetically conjugate atmospheric regions, both the secondary electrons and the precipitating electrons with high (E {\textgreater} 600 eV) initial energies will travel back through the loss cone, become trapped in the magnetosphere, and redistribute the energy content of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. Thus, scattering of the secondary electrons by ECH and whistler mode chorus waves leads to an increase of the fraction of superthermal electron energy deposited into the core magnetospheric plasma.},

abstract = {As Alfven waves with finite extent perpendicular to the magnetic field propagate from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere, there is a region of parallel electric field in the "wave front" of the propagating wave. For short perpendicular wavelengths this parallel electric field can be large enough to accelerate electrons to auroral energies. This problem is solved for the case of uniform plasma density and background magnetic field. The parallel electric field solution is then applied to a background Maxwellian plasma to study the effects of the acceleration due to this field on the electron distribution function. Two effects are found: (1) the relatively modest acceleration of the bulk of the background electrons and (2) Fermi-like resonant acceleration of a small component of the electrons up to velocities of the order of twice the Alfven speed. Although both effects always occur, the response of the background electrons is a sensitive function of the magnitude, wavelength, and timescale associated with the driving perpendicular electric field. In particular, the latter effect does not produce a significant signature for all conditions. However, for reasonable values of perpendicular electric field magnitude and scale size, and plasma parameters appropriate for auroral field lines at altitudes around 7000 km near where the Alfven speed peaks, the effect can be significant.},

abstract = {Statistical results from a survey of 93 passes through the high-latitude extension of the plasma sheet of electron data from the Hydra instrument on the Polar spacecraft show that the values for electron density can range from 0.01 to 0.5 cm−3 with an average value around 0.1 cm−3 on the poleward side and 0.3 cm−3 on the equatorward side. Electron mean energy is found to have an average value near 900 eV on the equatorward side and 400 eV on the poleward side but varies from 100 eV to 4 keV. These values for density and mean energy are similar to those reported for measurements made in the equatorial plasma sheet by several previous spacecraft. The character of the electron distributions has been compared with Maxwellian and $\kappa$-distributions with the result that the $\kappa$-distribution with $\kappa$ ≤ 10 yields an acceptable fit to the data twice as often as a Maxwellian distribution. This is similar to results found in the equatorial plasma sheet for both electrons and ions. The variation of electron density and mean energy around their average values have been compared with several solar wind parameters which have been developed to correlate solar wind variation with magnetospheric activity level. Few of these parameters are found to provide significant correlation with high-latitude plasma sheet electron density or temperature with the notable exception of solar wind density and solar wind particle flux which correlate with plasma sheet density. },

abstract = {Magnetic impulse events were selected by a computer algorithm procedure from magnetic records obtained at the near cusp latitude conjugate stations Iqaluit, Northwest Territories, Canada, and South Pole Station, Antarctica. The algorithm was constructed to select large (≳ 50 nT in the vertical component of the magnetic field), short lived (6 to 12 min) events. These events were found to be highly localized in the 06 to 18 LT sector at the two stations. A strong minimum in occurrence was found during hour 11 LT. The field changes associated with these events can be interpreted as due to an approximately half-cycle, odd-mode, Alfv{\'{e}}n wave along a near-magnetopause flux tube. From the vertical magnetic deflections of the impulse events the directions of field-aligned currents into the conjugate ionospheres were inferred. In the morning LT sector, field-aligned currents were directed into the ionospheres, while in the afternoon LT sector, field-aligned currents were directed out of the ionospheres. These findings are comparable with the statistical results for quasi-stationary field-aligned currents and suggest that at the times of these events, Iqaluit and South Pole are at a higher effective magnetic latitude. The average deflection in the vertical component for the events was measured to be ∼ 95 nT. From this the magnitude of the average field-aligned currents was calculated to be J∥ ∼ 2 × 10−7 A/m².},

abstract = {It is commonly assumed that the aurora borealis (Northern Hemisphere) and aurora australis (Southern Hemisphere) are mirror images of each other because the charged particles causing the aurora follow the magnetic field lines connecting the two hemispheres. The particles are believed to be evenly distributed between the two hemispheres, from the source region in the equatorial plane of the magnetosphere. Although it has been shown that similar auroral features in the opposite hemispheres can be displaced tens of degree in longitude1, 2 and that seasonal effects can cause differences in global intensity3, 4, the overall auroral patterns were still similar. Here we report observations that clearly contradict the common assumption about symmetric aurora: intense spots are seen at dawn in the Northern summer Hemisphere, and at dusk in the Southern winter Hemisphere. The asymmetry is interpreted in terms of inter-hemispheric currents related to seasons, which have been predicted5, 6 but hitherto had not been seen.},

abstract = {Observed velocity space distributions of magnetospheric and coronal electron and proton spectra are well represented by a power law in particle speed and are commonly modeled by a $\kappa$-distribution. The non-Maxwellian, superthermal tails of such distributions may result from an acceleration mechanism by wave–particle interaction due to the presence of broadband lower hybrid or Alfv{\'{e}}n wave turbulence. In the latter context, the problem of charged particle dragging by plasma waves is modeled within the Fokker–Planck formalism, where the velocity space diffusion is induced by the Cherenkov interaction. The numerical simulation of the temporal evolution of the distribution function is discussed on the basis of a wave driven acceleration process, possibly saturated by collisional drag. From the time evolution of the electron distribution function it is demonstrated that in particular Alfv{\'{e}}n wave interaction generates a superthermal particle population exhibiting high energy tails, consistent with the family of $\kappa$-distributions.},

@article{Liou1998,
abstract = {We performed a high-time resolution (5 min) correlative study of the energy deposition rate in the northern auroral zone with the concurrent solar wind plasma and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) observations for a 4 month period from March 30 to July 29, 1996. Auroral power, inferred by auroral emissions, was derived from images acquired by the ultraviolet imager (UVI) on board the Polar satellite, and the interplanetary parameters were based on Wind observations. It is found that dayside aurorae in the afternoon sector (65°–80° magnetic latitude (MLAT) and 1300–1800 magnetic local time (MLT)) are more active for large IMF cone angles and large solar wind electric fields. This result can be attributed to the manifestation of the antiparallel magnetic field merging in different locations and the partial “penetration” of the IMF on the dayside magnetopause. The integrated nightside (60°–75° MLAT and 2000–0100 MLT) auroral brightness is moderately correlated with the north–south component of the IMF and the solar wind speed with correlation coefficients of 0.49 and 0.35, respectively. The mean nightside auroral power is found to be approximately linearly proportional to the IMF Bz with a constant slope of 2 GW/nT. The solar wind speed, however, affects the nightside auroral power for both polarities of IMF Bz. Interestingly, the solar wind dynamic pressure shows no effect on the nightside auroral brightness. All these findings indicate that both reconnection and viscous-like interaction mechanisms play an important role in producing auroral emissions in the night sector. It is also found that the nightside auroral brightness responds to the southward turning of the IMF with a peak delay time of ∼60 min. This result favors the model of loading-unloading magnetosphere. We also found that a negative IMF By condition favors the nightside auroral activity, and we attributed this effect to the partial penetration of the IMF By. Finally, the response function for nightside aurora is given as ∼VB4Tsin4$\theta$c2) with a median correlation coefficient of 0.63, indicating that there may be other factors other than the solar wind and IMF responsible for lightening up the northern–southern hemispheric sky. },

Finding a quasi-constant value for the phase space minimum in a variety of different plasmas, similar to the classical Planck constant but 12 orders of magnitude larger may be revealing a new type of quantization in many plasmas and correlated systems more generally.},

abstract = {In this paper we examine the physical foundations and theoretical development of the kappa distribution, which arises naturally from non-extensive Statistical Mechanics. The kappa distribution provides a straightforward replacement for the Maxwell distribution when dealing with systems in stationary states out of thermal equilibrium, commonly found in space and astrophysical plasmas. Prior studies have used a variety of inconsistent, and sometimes incorrect, formulations, which have led to significant confusion about these distributions. Therefore, in this study, we start from the N-particle phase space distribution and develop seven formulations for kappa distributions that range from the most general to several specialized versions that can be directly used with common types of space data. Collectively, these formulations and their guidelines provide a ``toolbox'' of useful and statistically well-grounded equations for future space physics analyses that seek to apply kappa distributions in data analysis, simulations, modeling, theory, and other work.},

abstract = {Observed distributions of high-speed plasma flows at distances of 10 to 30 Earth radii (R(E)) in Earth's magnetotail neutral sheet are highly skewed toward the premidnight sector. The flows are a product of the magnetic reconnection process that converts magnetic energy stored in the magnetotail into plasma kinetic and thermal energy. We show, using global numerical simulations, that the electrodynamic interaction between Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere produces an asymmetry consistent with observed distributions in nightside reconnection and plasmasheet flows and in accompanying ionospheric convection. The primary causal agent is the meridional gradient in the ionospheric Hall conductance which, through the Cowling effect, regulates the distribution of electrical currents flowing within and between the ionosphere and magnetotail.},

abstract = {In spite of the great progress achieved in the understanding the Earth's magnetosphere-ionosphere system, its configuration and dynamics during periods with large horizontal interplanetary magnetic field (IMF ∣B y ∣ {\$}\backslashgg{\$} 0) is still poorly investigated. In such time intervals, the cusp/low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL) entry regions are characterized by a more complex magnetic reconnection topology, than during IMF B z -dominated periods, which in turn leads to peculiar magnetosheath plasma injections into the magnetosphere and associated ionospheric signatures. In this context, we discuss the 19 December 2002 dayside aurora activity, observed by the ITACA2 twin all-sky camera system, along the Greenland-Svalbard sector, during a nearly horizontal IMF (B y ∼ 15 nT and B z ∼ 0). The event originates from a longitudinally bifurcated cusp configuration and then develops into quasi-periodic red aurora activations, between about 1000 and 1140 UT. By analyzing the Greenlandic magnetometer data, we identify a series of westward traveling convection vortices (TCVs), moving away from magnetic noon at 2–3 km/s and synchronized with the transit of red-dominated auroral forms. We find that the auroral emission takes place in coincidence with the ionospheric footprint of the downward field-aligned currents (counterclockwise TCVs), instead of the upward ones (clockwise TCVs), as it would be expected for precipitating electrons. This fact and several analogies with previously reported quasi-periodic TCV activity, observed during IMF B y -dominated periods, suggest that the geomagnetic activity could be associated with FACs that are triggered by the magnetic merging on the dayside, either by inducing azimuthal pressure gradients at the magnetopause or by driving magnetopause/LLBL wave activity.},

abstract = {Event analyses and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling provide complementary insights into solar-wind/magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling when the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) has a stronger Y than Z component. The sources for convection and particle precipitation within the cusp become spatially bifurcated. Incoming surfaces of constant phase in the interplanetary electric field (IEF) can be tilted with respect to the Sun-Earth line. This forces the two hemispheres to respond to the same elements of the solar wind stream at significantly different times. We consider a case in which ground and rocket measurements indicate that IEF phase planes interacted first with the magnetopause in the Southern Hemisphere at lag times significantly less than the simple adjection time between an L1 monitor and Earth. Magnetic merging on the Northern Hemisphere magnetopause occurred later. The timing differences are related to the phase-plane tilts and the strong IMF BX. Auroral emissions created by electrons injected from the Southern Hemisphere merging line can appear in close proximity to those from Northern Hemisphere sites, within an all-sky imager's field-of-view. Bifurcation is driven by IMF BY, while BX controls differences in the timing of interactions with the two hemispheres. Detailed harmonization of auroral features with interplanetary drivers strongly supports the utility of the antiparallel merging criterion for estimating when and where the IMF-magnetosphere interactions occur. We compare empirical results with MHD simulations to help constrain interpretations of magnetospheric boundary layers. Merging at high latitudes creates layers of open field lines that drape over the dayside magnetosphere to form an open boundary layer. MHD modeling suggests that open boundary layers may become quite thick along the magnetospheric flank equatorward of the sash. Simulations and the empirical results indicate that merging in the conjugate hemisphere drives the smaller ionospheric convection cell.},

One class observed during quiet times consists of a continuous series of vortices moving generally anti-sunward for several hours at a time. Assuming each vortex to be the convection pattern produced by a small field aligned current moving across the ionosphere, we find the amount of field aligned current by fitting a modeled ground magnetic signature to measurements from the chain of magnetometers. The calculated field aligned current is seen to be steady for each vortex and neighboring vortices have currents of opposite sign. Low altitude DMSP observations indicate the vortices are on field lines which map to the inner edge of the low latitude boundary layer. Because the vortices are conjugate to the boundary layer, repeat in a regular fashion and travel anit-sunward, we argue that this class of vortices is caused by surface waves at the magnetopause. No strong correlations between field aligned current strength and solar wind density, velocity, or Bz is found.},

@article{McHenry1990b,
abstract = {In a companion paper we have shown that many continuous, dayside, high latitude magnetic pulsations are caused by steady, traveling ionospheric convection vortices (McHenry et al. this issue). A variety of evidence indicates that these vortices are the ionospheric signatures of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the inner edge of the magnetospheric boundary layer. In this paper we present the results of a statistical study of the occurrence of these vortices and the upstream solar wind parameters observed by the IMP 8 spacecraft. Surveying fifty days of Greenland west coast chain magnetometer data indicates this class of pulsations is most likely to be detected post local noon and when the solar wind speed is low. However, it is possible that observational factors significantly affect the detection of the vortices. The slow solar wind might create large, slow moving traveling vortices of steady strength which are easiest to identify. Little correlation is found between the average IMF and the probability of detecting the vortices. We also find a strong correlation between the frequency of dayside pulsations and the solar wind speed. This suggests that many pulsations are caused by traveling ionospheric current systems that map to the vicinity of the flows in the magnetospheric boundary layer. Periods also exist when the IMF is variable and large pulsations with 5 to 20 min period exist. These pulsations are not caused by traveling ionospheric vortices but are likely to be the result of rapid variations of the large scale field-aligned cusp currents.},

abstract = {We present results of a global, fully three-dimensional, high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the
                  magnetosphere during steady northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. We investigate the stability of
                  the magnetospheric boundary with respect to the growth of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) driven by the
                  velocity shear between the nearly stagnant magnetospheric plasma and the magnetosheath flow past it. We find the
                  magnetospheric boundary to be globally unstable, including the high-latitude boundary layer (meridional plane), where
                  magnetic tension is not sufficient to stabilize the growth of oscillations. Roughly beyond the terminator, global
                  modes coupled into the surface modes become most apparent, so that the entire body of the magnetosphere is engaged in
                  an oscillatory motion. The wave vector of the surface oscillations has a component perpendicular to the background
                  flow and tangential to the shear layer (in the equatorial plane, kz component of the wave vector), which is
                  consistent with the generation of field-aligned currents that flow on closed field lines between the inner portion of
                  the boundary layer and the ionosphere. The distribution of wave power in the equatorial plane is consistent with the
                  existence of a double-vortex sheet, with vortex trains propagating along the inner and outer edges of the boundary
                  layer. The double-vortex sheet is most apparent in the simulation past the terminator plane but is transient and
                  appears to be unstable and is most likely a consequence of nonlinear development of the velocity shear layer with a
                  finite width. For the simulation with the solar wind velocity of 600 km/s, we find the width of the layer to be
                  $\Delta$≈1 RE at the terminator and the phase speed there to be similar to half of the total velocity drop across the
                  layer (∼440 km/s), which is expected for a shear layer with uniform background density. We calculate the spatial
                  growth rate for the dominant frequency mode in this region (∼4.4 mHz) to be ∼0.19RE−1, which is in excellent
                  agreement with linear theory. For this mode, we find k$\Delta$≈0.9, where k is the wave number, which corresponds to
                  the fastest growing mode predicted by the linear theory. Finally, we find that the plasma compressibility is a key
                  factor in controlling the growth rate of the KHI at the magnetosphere flanks in our simulation.},

The inductive response to the switching on and off of the solar wind-magnetosphere generator exceeds the effect of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) variation. The induction effects are most apparent during the substorm expansion onset when the rapid growth of the ionospheric conductivity is accompanied by the fast release of the magnetic energy stored in the magnetotail during the growth phase.

abstract = {There are two main categories of acceleration processes in the Earth's auroral zone: those based on quasi-static structures, and those based on Alfv{\'{e}}n wave (AW). AWs play a nonnegligible role in the global energy budget of the plasma surrounding the Earth because they participate in auroral acceleration, and because auroral acceleration conveys a large portion of the energy flux across the magnetosphere. Acceleration events by double layers (DLs) and by AW have mostly been investigated separately, but many studies cited in this chapter show that they are not independent: these processes can occur simultaneously, and one process can be the cause of the other. The quasi-simultaneous occurrences of acceleration by AW and by quasi-static structures have been observed predominantly at the polar cap boundary of auroral arc systems, where often new bright arcs develop or intensify.},

abstract = {Analysis of a single traveling convection vortex (TCV) event that combines magnetometer, auroral imager, and riometer observations from conjugate hemispheres provides a complete view of the field-aligned current (FAC) system associated with the TCV. Conjugate observations clearly show that the TCV is a pair of FACs that flow alternatively out of and then into both ionospheres. Imaging observations at 427.8 nm indicate that the upward FAC region is associated with a narrow arc 50–100 km wide and at least 600 km long. Mapping the imaging observations made in the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern Hemisphere shows excellent collocation of the precipitation with the flow vortex associated with the upward FAC as inferred from a large two-dimensional network of magnetometers. Also consistent with the flows inferred from the magnetometers, the arc is found to be skewed with respect to the direction of motion of the transient. Low-altitude spacecraft passes near the time of the event suggest that the FAC is coincident with, and possibly confined to, a relatively narrow region (less than 3° in latitude) in which 1–10 keV electrons characteristic of the central plasma sheet are present.},

abstract = {We calculate growth rates and corresponding gains for right-hand circularly polarized extraordinary (RX) and left-hand ordinary circularly polarized (LO) mode radiation associated with the cyclotron maser instability (CMI) for parameterized horseshoe electron velocity distributions. The velocity distribution function was modeled to closely fit the electron distribution functions observed in the auroral cavity. We systematically varied the model parameters as well as the propagation direction to study the dependence of growth rates on model parameters. The growth rate depends strongly on loss cone opening angle, which must be less than 90° for significant CMI growth. The growth rate is sharply peaked for perpendicular radiation (k∥ = 0), with a full width at half maximum 1.7°, in good agreement with observed k-vector orientations and numerical simulations. The fractional bandwidth varied between 10−4 and 10−2, depending most strongly on propagation direction. This range encompasses nearly all observed fractional auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) burst bandwidths. We find excellent agreement between the computed RX mode emergent intensities and observed AKR intensities assuming convective growth length Lc ≈ 20–40 km and group speed 0.15c. The only computed LO mode growth rates compatible observed LO mode radiation levels occurred for number densities more than 100 times the average energetic electron densities measured in auroral cavities. This implies that LO mode radiation is not produced directly by the CMI mechanism but more likely results from mode conversion of RX mode radiation. We find that perturbation of the model velocity distribution by large ion solitary waves (ion holes) can enhance the growth rate by a factor of 2–4. This will result in a gain enhancement more than 40 dB depending on the convective growth length within the structure. Similar enhancements may be caused by strong electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves.},

abstract = {The entry of solar wind into the magnetosphere is strongly influenced by kinetic-scale boundary layers where the rapid variation in the magnetic field and/or velocity can drive transport. In current layers with strong Alfv{\'{e}}nic velocity shear, the generation of vortices from the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability can drive magnetic reconnection even in broader current sheets by locally compressing these layers as the vortices develop. Previous two-dimensional (2-D) fully kinetic simulations of this vortex-induced reconnection process have demonstrated the copious formation of magnetic islands in regions of strongly compressed current between the vortices. Here we describe the first three-dimensional (3-D) fully kinetic simulations of this process and demonstrate that the compressed current sheets give rise to magnetic flux ropes over a range of oblique angles and along the entire extent of the compressed current layer around the periphery of the vortex. These flux ropes propagate with the shear flow and eventually merge with the vortex. Over longer time scales, this basic scenario is repeated as the vortices drive new compressed current sheets. In the final stage, the vortices undergo a merging process that drives new compressed current sheets and flux ropes. Based on these simulations, a simple model is proposed that predicts the size of these flux ropes relative to their parent vortex. Both the relative sizes as well as the structure of the profiles across the vortex are in reasonable agreement with Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions (THEMIS) observations at the Earth's low-latitude magnetopause.},

Using high time resolution data from GEOTAIL just upstream of the bowshock and within 10 earth radii of the sun-earth line, we were able to clearly identify solar wind triggers for 30 of 31 large amplitude TCV events during 1995. These data showed that 20 of the 30 solar wind drivers were isolated foreshock cavities of the type that have been previously reported. A further 8 events belong to a similar class which occurred primarily during rapid rotations of the IMF from or to a radial orientation, accompanied by a foreshock cavity-like region at the edge of the IMF transition. These observations suggest that the vast majority of TCVs are driven by perturbations of the magnetosphere caused by foreshock cavities that are formed in the interaction between the IMF and the bowshock.},

abstract = {The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is a key process for the transport of solar wind plasma into the Earth's magnetosphere when the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is northward. Previous kinetic simulations for symmetric layers have demonstrated that the flow vortices compress the magnetopause current layer and induce magnetic reconnection, leading to the rapid streaming of solar wind plasma into the vortices along newly reconnected field lines. Using fully kinetic 3-D simulations, we demonstrate that the inherent density asymmetry across the boundary layer leads to a spectrum of oblique interchange instabilities along the magnetospheric side of the vortices. These secondary instabilities give rise to turbulence, which transports the solar wind plasma originally stored within the flow vortices deep into the magnetosphere. Simple estimates suggest that this turbulent transport may contribute significantly to the formation of the Earth's low-latitude boundary layer and the cold-dense plasma sheet during prolonged periods of northward IMF.},

abstract = {We investigated whether one or a few coupling functions can represent best the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere over a wide variety of magnetospheric activity. Ten variables which characterize the state of the magnetosphere were studied. Five indices from ground-based magnetometers were selected, namely Dst, Kp, AE, AU, and AL, and five from other sources, namely auroral power (Polar UVI), cusp latitude (sin($\Lambda$c)), b2i (both DMSP), geosynchronous magnetic inclination angle (GOES), and polar cap size (SuperDARN). These indices were correlated with more than 20 candidate solar wind coupling functions. One function, representing the rate magnetic flux is opened at the magnetopause, correlated best with 9 out of 10 indices of magnetospheric activity. This is d$\Phi$MP/dt = v4/3BT2/3sin8/3($\theta$c/2), calculated from (rate IMF field lines approach the magnetopause, ∼v)({\%} of IMF lines which merge, sin8/3($\theta$c/2))(interplanetary field magnitude, BT)(merging line length, ∼(BMP/BT)1/3). The merging line length is based on flux matching between the solar wind and a dipole field and agrees with a superposed IMF on a vacuum dipole. The IMF clock angle dependence matches the merging rate reported (albeit with limited statistics) at high altitude. The nonlinearities of the magnetospheric response to BT and v are evident when the mean values of indices are plotted, in scatterplots, and in the superior correlations from d$\Phi$MP/dt. Our results show that a wide variety of magnetospheric phenomena can be predicted with reasonable accuracy (r {\textgreater} 0.80 in several cases) ab initio, that is without the time history of the target index, by a single function, estimating the dayside merging rate. Across all state variables studied (including AL, which is hard to predict, and polar cap size, which is hard to measure), d$\Phi$MP/dt accounts for about 57.2{\%} of the variance, compared to 50.9{\%} for EKL and 48.8{\%} for vBs. All data sets included at least thousands of points over many years, up to two solar cycles, with just two parameter fits, and the correlations are thus robust. The sole index which does not correlate best with d$\Phi$MP/dt is Dst, which correlates best (r = 0.87) with p1/2d$\Phi$MP/dt. If d$\Phi$MP/dt were credited with this success, its average score would be even higher.},

abstract = {We combine 4861 identifications of substorm onsets from satellite global imagers (Polar UVI and IMAGE FUV) with DMSP particle data to investigate the substorm cycle dependence of the diffuse aurora (electrons and ions), monoenergetic aurora (produced by quasi-static electric fields), and broadband aurora (associated with Alfv{\'{e}}nic acceleration). Although all types of aurora increase at substorm onset, broadband aurora shows a particular association with substorms and, especially, substorm onset. While diffuse electron and monoenergetic auroral precipitating power rises by 79{\%} and 90{\%}, respectively, following an onset, wave aurora rises by 182{\%}. In the first 10–15 min following onset, the power associated with Alfv{\'{e}}nic acceleration is comparable to monoenergetic acceleration (also called “inverted V” events). In general, this is not the case before onset, or indeed, during recovery. The rise time of the electron diffuse aurora following onset is much slower, about 50 min, and thus presumably extends into recovery. Discrete acceleration, which rises over just a few minutes, is already deep into decline, while diffuse auroral power is still rising. Most of the sharp increase in Alfv{\'{e}}nic precipitating power at onset is associated with a 132{\%} jump in the characteristic energy associated with broadband acceleration. Previous work has associated PiB signatures (which are compressional) in the magnetotail with dipolarization. More recently, FAST observations near the auroral zone have been used to show that there are nearly simultaneous sharp increases in Alfv{\'{e}}n waves, apparently created by mode coupling. The present work strongly supports the idea that the Alfv{\'{e}}nic aurora has a particular connection to substorm onsets, with much of the auroral power over a substorm cycle concentrated shortly after onset. Finally, a superposed epoch analysis of commonly used coupling functions indicates a drop in the mean solar wind driving starting 20 min before substorm onset. However, the distribution of increases and decreases in solar wind driving is roughly symmetric about a peak at zero (no change) but with (rare) large drops in solar wind driving (“northward turnings”) outweighing large increases. Comparison with the distribution of random changes in solar wind driving leads us to suggest that probably only a minority of substorms are externally driven.},

abstract = {OVATION Prime (OP) is an auroral precipitation model parameterized by solar wind driving. Distinguishing features of the model include an optimized solar wind-magnetosphere coupling function (d$\Phi$MP/dt) which predicts auroral power significantly better than Kp or other traditional parameters, the separation of aurora into categories (diffuse aurora, monoenergetic, broadband, and ion), the inclusion of seasonal variations, and separate parameter fits for each magnetic latitude (MLAT) × magnetic local time (MLT) bin, thus permitting each type of aurora and each location to have differing responses to season and solar wind input—as indeed they do. We here introduce OVATION Prime-2013, an upgrade to the 2010 version currently widely available. The most notable advantage of OP-2013 is that it uses UV images from the GUVI instrument on the satellite TIMED for high disturbance levels (d$\Phi$MP/dt {\textgreater} 1.2 MWb/s which roughly corresponds to Kp = 5+ or 6−). The range of validity is approximately 0 {\textless} d$\Phi$MP/dt ≤ 3.0 MWb/s (Kp about 8+). Other upgrades include a reduced susceptibility to salt-and-pepper noise, and smoother interpolation across the postmidnight data gap. The model is tested against an independent data set of hemispheric auroral power from Polar UVI. Over the common range of validity of OP-2010 and OP-2013, the two models predict auroral power essentially identically, primarily because hemispheric power calculations were done in a way to minimize the impact of OP-2010s noise. To quantitatively demonstrate the improvement at high disturbance levels would require multiple very large substorms, which are rare, and insufficiently present in the limited data set of Polar UVI hemispheric power values. Nonetheless, although OP-2010 breaks down in a variety of ways above Kp = 5+ or 6−, OP-2013 continues to show the auroral oval advancing equatorward, at least to 55° MLAT or a bit less, and OP-2013 does not develop spurious large noise patches. We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of other precipitation models more generally, as no one model fits best all possible uses.},

abstract = {We have performed 13 three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the magnetosheath plasma and magnetic field properties for Parker spiral (PS) and ortho-Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) orientations corresponding to a wide range of solar wind plasma conditions. To study the growth of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the dawn and dusk flank magnetopause, we have performed 26 local two-dimensional MHD simulations, with the initial conditions taken from global simulations on both sides of the velocity shear layer at the dawn-dusk terminator. These simulations indicate that while the MHD physics of the fast shocks does not directly lead to strong asymmetry of the magnetosheath temperature for typical solar wind conditions, the magnetosheath on the quasi-parallel shock side has a smaller tangential magnetic field along the magnetosheath flow which enables faster growth of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). Because the IMF is statistically mostly in the PS orientation, the KHI formation may statistically favor the dawnside flank. For all the 26 simulations, the growth rates of the KHI correlated well with the ratio of the velocity shear and Alfv{\'{e}}n speed along the wave vector, k. Dynamics of the KHI may subsequently lead to formation of kinetic Alfv{\'{e}}n waves and reconnection in the Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices which can lead to particle energization. This may partly help to explain the observed plasma sheet asymmetry of cold-component ions, which are heated more on the dawnside plasma sheet.},

abstract = {This paper reports on properties of energetic electrons observed by the Auroral Particle Detector (APD) on board the sounding rocket S-310-35, which was launched from And/0ya Rocket Range, Norway, at 0033:00 UT on 13 December 2004 during the DELTA campaign. The APD was designed to measure energy spectra of energetic electrons in the range of 3.5 to 65 keV every 10 ms using avalanche photodiodes. The measurement was done at altitudes of 90–140 km (apogee height of the rocket flight), which corresponded to the collisional interaction region of precipitating electrons with the atmospheric constituents. The overall profile of energetic electron precipitations was consistent with auroral images taken from the ground. The downward fluxes almost always exceeded those of upward electrons, and the ratio of downward to upward fluxes increased with energy and also with altitude. This is reasonably understood in terms of the effect of collisions between the energetic electrons and the atmospheric constituents. An interesting feature in energy spectra of precipitating electrons is the existence of non-thermal electrons at higher energies, regardless of inside or outside of auroral arcs. In order to predict the incident downward spectra at the top of the atmosphere, we have applied an analytic method of Luhmann (1976) to evaluate the collisional effect on the electron spectra. As a result, most of the observed energy spectra of precipitating electrons are well expressed by kappa distributions with the thermal energy of a few hundreds of eV and kappa of 5–8, while the spectrum inside a strong arc is better fitted by the sum of a Maxwellian distribution on the lower energy side and a power law at higher energies. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first direct and reliable measurement of energy spectra of electrons in the 10-keV energy range in the auroral ionosphere.},

abstract = {We study the question of what difference it makes for the derived field-aligned conductance (K) values if one uses Maxwellian or kappa distributions for the fitting of low-orbiting satellite electron flux spectra in the auroral region. This question has arisen because sometimes a high-energy tail is seen in the spectra. In principle, the kappa fits should always be better, because the kappa distribution is a generalization of the Maxwellian. However, the physical meaning of the parameters appearing in the Maxwellian is clearer. It therefore makes sense to study under which circumstances it is appropriate to use a Maxwellian. We use Freja electron data (TESP and MATE) from two events. One of the events represents quiet magnetospheric conditions (stable arc) and the other represents disturbed conditions (surge). In these Freja events, at least, using kappa rather than Maxwellian fitting gives a better fit to the observed distribution, but the difference in K values is not large (usually less than 20{\{}{\%}{\}}). The difference can be of either sign. However, sometimes even the kappa distribution does not provide a good fit, and one needs a more complicated distribution such as two Maxwellians. We investigate the relative contributions of the two Maxwellians to the total field-aligned conductance value in these cases. We find that the contribution of the high-energy population is insignificant (usually much less than 20{\{}{\%}{\}}). This is because K is proportional to n/□E c E c , where n is the source plasma density and E c is the characteristic energy.},

abstract = {We have investigated the high{\&}hyphen;altitude cusp location and its dependence on the interplanetary magnetic field {\&}lpar;IMF{\&}rpar; Bz, solar wind Ey, and solar wind dynamic pressure during steady solar wind conditions. We have adopted strict event selection criteria, where we have studied only events during stationary IMF Bz, when the cusp latitude is supposed to be stationary. Prior to this study, the statistical studies have shown a great deal of scatter between the cusp latitude and the IMF Bz; however, with the strict event selection criteria, we have been able to reduce the scatter. The strongest source of scatter comes from large and largely fluctuating IMF By. When the events are selected during small IMF By, the scattering between the cusp latitude and the IMF Bz is reduced. When IMF is southward, also the fluctuation of IMF By has strong influence on the cusp latitude, whereas for northward IMF, the IMF By fluctuation has less influence on the cusp latitude. For larger southward IMF the cusp appears further equatorward than with smaller southward IMF. When the scatter is reduced by introducing the IMF By control, the larger northward IMF brings the cusp to lower latitudes than the smaller northward IMF, i.e., the maximum cusp latitude is obtained for small positive IMF Bz. For increasing solar wind Ez the cusp moves equatorward. Furthermore, with increasing solar wind dynamic pressure, the cusp appears at lower latitudes. This behavior depends on the orientation of the IMF Bz, with southward IMF the cusp moves faster equatorward than with northward IMF.},

abstract = {On 26 January 2001, the Cluster spacecraft detected high-speed plasma jets at multiple crossings of the high-latitude duskside magnetopause (MP) and boundary layer (BL) over a period of more than 2 h. The 4 spacecraft combined spent more than half of this time in the MP/BL and jets were observed whenever a spacecraft was in the MP. These observations were made under steady southward and dawnward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. The magnetic shear across the local MP was similar to 100degrees and beta similar to 1 in the adjacent magnetosheath. The jet velocity is in remarkable agreement with reconnection prediction throughout the entire interval, except for one crossing that had no ion measurements inside the current layer. The flow speed measured in the deHoffmann Teller frame is 90{\%} of the Alfven speed on average for the 10 complete MP current layer crossings that are resolved by the ion measurements. These findings strongly suggest that reconnection was continuously active for more than two hours. The jets were directed persistently in the same northward and anti-sunward direction, implying that the X-line was always below the spacecraft. This feature is inconsistent with patchy and random reconnection or convecting multiple X-lines. The majority of MP/BL crossings in this two-hour interval were partial crossings, implying that they are caused by bulges sliding along the MP, not by inward-outward motion of a uniformly thin MP/BL. The presence of the bulges suggests that, although reconnection is continuously active under steady IMF conditions, its rate may be modulated. The present investigation also reveals that (1) the predicted ion D-shaped distributions are absent in all reconnection jets on this day, (2) the electric field fluctuations are larger in the reconnecting MP than in the magnetosheath proper, but their amplitudes never exceed 20 mV/m, (3) the ion-electron differential motion is similar to20 km/s for the observed MP current density of similar to50 nA/m(2) (deduced from delxB), thus inconsequential for the deHoffmann-Teller and Walen analyses, (4) flows in an isolated flux transfer event (FTE) are directed in the same direction as the MP jets and satisfy the Walen relation, suggesting that this FTE is also generated by reconnection. Finally, the present event cannot be used to evaluate the validity of component or anti-parallel merging models because, although the magnetic shear at the local MP was similar to100degrees(much less than180degrees), the X-line may be located more than 9 R-E away (in the opposite hemisphere), where the shear could be substantially different.},

While the poleward part of the cusp exhibits the expected reverse dispersion due to lobe reconnection, its equatorward part shows a second ion population at higher-energy that coexists with the low energy tail of the dispersion. This second population is either dispersionless or slightly dispersed with energies increasing with increasing latitudes, indicative of lobe reconnection as well. Our analysis of a case that occurred 3 September 2002 when the IMF stayed northward for more than two hours suggests that the second population comes from the opposite hemisphere and is very likely on newly-closed field lines. We interpret this overlap of cusp populations as a clear mid-altitude signature of re-closed magnetic field lines by double lobe reconnection (reconnection in both hemispheres) under northward IMF. This interpretation is supported by modelling performed with the Cooling model and an MHD model.},

abstract = {Electron distributions obtained in the source regions of auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) by the Fast Auroral SnapshoT (FAST) satellite have revealed several free energy sources with positive gradients with respect to $\upsilon$⊥ superimposed on a broad plateau with a radius close to the primary incident electron acceleration energy and covering pitch angles from near field-aligned all the way to the (upgoing) loss cone. Two-dimensional electromagnetic particle simulations are used to demonstrate that such a distribution arises as a quasisteady feature of a process in which the increase of the perpendicular velocity of the electrons as they propagate into a region of increasing magnetic field strength is balanced by the diffusion to lower $\upsilon$⊥ caused by the electron-cyclotron maser instability. The maser radiation is emitted nearly perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field at frequencies between the relativistic and nonrelativistic cyclotron frequencies. In these circumstances, the entire primary auroral electron distribution can contribute to the resonant wave-particle interaction, leading to electric field intensities of the order of 500 mV/m. In contrast, a pure loss cone distribution is shown to produce much weaker electric fields, leads to emission at angles ≳ 10° away from perpendicular, and cannot produce the broad plateau observed in the electron distribution. The simulations and linear theory indicate that the maser instability in a uniform system produces an intrinsic bandwidth of the order of a few tenths of 1{\%} of the cyclotron frequency (∼0.5–1.0 kHz in the AKR source region). Any narrower spectra would appear to require some nonuniform or time-dependent feature in the source region.},

abstract = {We present an interval of extremely long-lasting narrow-band Pc5 pulsations during the recovery phase of a large geomagnetic storm. These pulsations occurred continuously for many hours and were observed throughout the magnetosphere and in the dusk-sector ionosphere. The subject of this paper is the favorable radial alignment of the Cluster, Polar, and geosynchronous satellites in the dusk sector during a 3-hour subset of this interval that allows extensive analysis of the global nature of the pulsations and the tracing of their energy transfer from the solar wind to the ground. Virtually monochromatic large-amplitude pulsations were observed by the CANOPUS magnetometer chain at dusk for several hours, during which the Cluster spacecraft constellation traversed the dusk magnetopause. The solar wind conditions were very steady, the solar wind speed was fast, and time series analysis of the solar wind dynamic pressure shows no significant power concentrated in the Pc5 band. The pulsations are observed in both geosynchronous electron and magnetic field data over a wide range of local times while Cluster is in the vicinity of the magnetopause providing clear evidence of boundary oscillations with the same periodicity as the ground and geosynchronous pulsations. Furthermore, the Polar spacecraft crossed the equatorial dusk magnetosphere outside of geosynchronous orbit (L ∼ 6–9) and observed significant electric and magnetic perturbations around the same quasi-stable central frequency (1.4–1.6 mHz). The Poynting vector observed by the Polar spacecraft associated with these pulsations has strong field-aligned oscillations, as expected for standing Alfv{\'{e}}n waves, as well as a nonzero azimuthal component, indicating a downtail component to the energy propagation. In the ionosphere, ground-based magnetometers observed signatures characteristic of a field-line resonance, and HF radars observed flows as a direct consequence of the energy input. We conclude that the most likely explanations is that magnetopause oscillations couple energy to field lines close to the location of Polar, setting up standing Alfv{\'{e}}n waves along the resonant field lines which are then also observed in the ionosphere. In the absence of monochromatic dynamic pressure variations in the solar wind, this event is a potential example where discrete frequency pulsations in the magnetosphere result from the excitation of a magnetospheric waveguide mode, perhaps excited via the Kelvin-Helmoltz instability or via overreflection at the duskside magnetopause. },

abstract = {Antiparallel merging at the magnetopause predicts a longitudinal bifurcation of the cusp during intervals of southeast or southwest interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) orientation. In the aurora this should manifest itself as a longitudinal gap in the midday sector, bracketed by bright auroral forms on either side. With the purpose of testing this prediction, we searched for an auroral signature in our database from the arctic islands of Svalbard, focusing on strong, isolated auroral brightenings belonging to the category of events which has been previously established as a signature of transient magnetopause reconnection (flux transfer events (FTEs)). We found some very interesting events, showing clear brightenings in the eastern and western parts of the field of view (FOV), with a gap in between. In this paper we present a 1 hour long interval of auroral observations in the 1100–1400 MLT sector, showing two strong, isolated auroral events, which were separated by 20 min. The IMF was steady and directed southeast (By = 3 nT; Bz = −3 nT; clock angle = 135°), in a solar wind of low speed (370 km s−1) and low dynamic pressure (0.2 nPa). Each auroral event is characterized by an initial, strong brightening of the cusp equatorward boundary, previously referred to as equatorward boundary intensification (EBI), which is followed by a westward and poleward moving auroral form (PMAF). The main point here is that the initial brightening is longitudinally bifurcated, with near-simultaneous auroral brightenings in the eastern (1300–1400 MLT) and western (1100–1130 MLT) parts of the all-sky camera FOV being separated by a ∼500 km wide “gap.” The brightening event is discussed as a possible signature of transient, antiparallel reconnection, taking place at high magnetopause latitudes, while the “gap” aurora is attributed to quasi steady component reconnection in the subsolar region.},

abstract = {The discrete aurora results when energized electrons bombard the Earth's atmosphere at high latitudes. This paper examines the physical processes that can cause field-aligned acceleration of plasma particles in the auroral region. A data and theoretical study has been carried out to examine the acceleration mechanisms that operate in the auroral zone and to identify the magnetospheric drivers of these acceleration mechanisms. The observations used in the study were collected by the Fast Auroral Snapshot (FAST) and Polar satellites when the two satellites were in approximate magnetic conjunction in the auroral region. During these events FAST was in the middle of the auroral zone and Polar was above the auroral zone in the near-Earth plasma sheet. Polar data were used to determine the conditions in the magnetotail at the time field-aligned acceleration was measured by FAST in the auroral zone. For each of the magnetotail drivers identified in the data study, the physics of field-aligned acceleration in the auroral region was examined using existing theoretical efforts and/or a long-system particle in cell simulation to model the magnetically connected region between the two satellites. Results from the study indicate that there are three main drivers of auroral acceleration: (1) field-aligned currents that lead to quasistatic parallel potential drops (parallel electric fields), (2) earthward flow of high-energy plasma beams from the magnetotail into the auroral zone that lead to quasistatic parallel potential drops, and (3) large-amplitude Alfv{\'{e}}n waves that propagate into the auroral region from the magnetotail. The events examined thus far confirm the previously established invariant latitudinal dependence of the drivers and show a strong dependence on magnetic activity. Alfv{\'{e}}n waves tend to occur primarily at the poleward edge of the auroral region during more magnetically active times and are correlated with intense electron precipitation. At lower latitudes away from the poleward edge of the auroral zone is the primary field-aligned current region which results in the classical field-aligned acceleration associated with the auroral zone (electrons earthward and ion beams tailward). During times of high magnetic activity, high-energy ion beams originating from the magnetotail are observed within, and overlapping, the regions of primary and return field-aligned current. Along the field lines where the high-energy magnetotail ion beams are located, field-aligned acceleration can occur in the auroral zone leading to precipitating electrons and upwelling ionospheric ion beams. Field-aligned currents are present during both quiet and active times, while the Alfv{\'{e}}n waves and magnetotail ion beams were observed only during more magnetically active events. During quiet times (no storm or substorm), the field-aligned currents were relatively weak with the resulting electron precipitation in the primary current region correspondingly weak, and for the quiescent events examined here, upwelling ion beams were not observed. The results presented here support the overall contention that processes in the magnetotail lead to field-aligned auroral acceleration and discrete aurora during active events, however, it is not a single process but several processes acting at the same time and at different locations in latitude.},

@article{Scudder1979,
abstract = {A new detailed first principle kinetic theory for electrons is presented which is neither a classical fluid treatment nor an expospheric calculation. This new theory illustrates the global and local properties of the solar wind expansion that shape the observed features of the electron distribution function fe, such as its bifurcation, its skewness, and the ‘differential' temperatures of the thermal and suprathermal subpopulations. Our approach starts with the Boltzmann equation and retains the effects of Coulomb collisions via a Krook collision operator without recourse to wave-particle effects. We conclude that Coulomb collisions determine the population and shape of fe in both the thermal (E {\textless}kT) and suprathermal (E {\textgreater}kT) energy regimes. We find that electrons with E {\textgreater}7kT constitute a special subpopulation of the suprathermals, insofar as Coulomb collisions are concerned; these we call ‘extrathermals.' The electrons in the thermal portion of fe have undergone ∼10-20 Coulomb collisions for cumulative momentum transfer en route to the observer at 1 AU; this population is thus more removed from the properties of coronal electrons than the suprathermal population. This latter group retains a strong memory of coronal conditions, since they have undergone only a few momentum transfer collisions. The thermal population is most nearly in collisional contact with the local dynamics (compressions, rarefactions, etc.) of the solar wind. The suprathermal portion of fe is determined by Coulomb collisional interactions with the distribution of solar wind material on radial scale of the heliopause itself. In this respect the suprathermal portion of fe is found to be responsive to the consequences of the global dynamics of the solar wind expansion. We find that this subpopulation is an attenuated vestige of collisional populations deep in the corona (1.03–10 Rs) which has been redistributed via Coulomb multiple pitch angle scattering on magnetically open field lines. The suprathermal particles moving toward the sun are computed to be observed as a result of Coulomb-collision-induced backscattering at larger (1–10 AU) heliocentric distances than that of the observer. Based on this theoretical picture, quantitative estimates for the partition of thermal and suprathermal phase density, the break in the velocity distribution, and the magnitude of the skewness (heat flux density) agree well with those typically observed near 1 AU. These calculations predict that the extrathermal fraction of the phase density, the extrathermal temperature, and the net heat flux density carried by electrons should be anticorrelated with the local bulk speed in quasi-steady-state flows and that the radial variation of extrathermal temperature inside 1 AU should be essentially independent of heliocentric distance. Our work also shows that the observation of suprathermal particles cannot be taken as a priori evidence for in situ wave particle interaction(s), since we can theoretically calculate a suprathermal population of solar wind electrons at 1 AU by assuming wave-particle interactions are not present anywhere in the heliospheric cavity; the combination of inhomogeneity and the Coulomb ‘window' above E*=7kTc naturally gives rise to this leakage of nonlocal collisional populations in superposition with local collisional populations. This work suggests that the local cause and effect precept which permeates the physics of denser media must be relaxed for electrons in sparse and radically inhomogeneous plasmas such as those found in the solar wind between the lower corona and the interstellar medium. The local form of transport laws and equations of state (e.g., Q =−$\kappa$ ▽,T,P=NkT), which are familiar from collision-dominated plasmas, must be replaced with global relations that explicitly depend on the relative position of the observer to the boundaries of the system. },

abstract = {Variations of the ion flux and magnetic field magnitude in the undisturbed solar wind, in the foreshock, and in the magnetosheath have been examined using simultaneous measurements on the INTERBALL-1, IMP 8, WIND and ACE spacecraft. A high-time resolution of INTERBALL-1 measurements has allowed us to observe variations of these parameters in a broad range of frequencies (0.01–1 Hz). In this frequency range, magnetosheath plasma and field parameters fluctuate with very large amplitudes and are subjected to extremely intensive variations even during “quiet” conditions in the solar wind. The dependence of magnetosheath variations on the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) direction was investigated. It was found that during the quasi-parallel IMF orientation to the bow shock normal (i.e., when $\Theta$ Bn {\textless} 45 ∘ ), an increase in the amplitude of variations of the ion flux and magnetic field is observed not only ahead of the bow shock (in the foreshock region) but also behind it, i.e., in the magnetosheath. The $\Theta$ Bn angle turned out to be the parameter, which significantly affects the properties of the turbulent plasma flow. An application of a spectral analysis allowed us to show substantial differences in the frequency properties of variations of the ion flux and magnetic field magnitude in the undisturbed solar wind, foreshock, and magnetosheath (separately for the quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular conditions of the bow shock).},

abstract = {[1] Various boundary crossings in the vicinity of the high-altitude cusp region were experienced by the Cluster spacecraft when the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) was northward. In contrast to the southward IMF cases, in which a turbulent and diffusive entry layer is present equatorward of the cusp, a transition layer (without significant turbulence and diffusive properties) that shows clear differences in plasma parameters (sometimes step-like profile) compared to the adjacent regions was observed. We suggest that this transition layer, which contains both magnetosheath and magnetospheric populations, is the entry layer during northward IMF conditions. This transition layer is possibly formed by dual-lobe reconnection when the IMF is northward. The plasma property and the closed field line geometry of this layer indicate that it is possibly linked to the low-latitude boundary layer. The width of this layer varies from 480 to 2200 km. The results support the notion that high-latitude dual-lobe reconnection is a potential mechanism of the transport of solar wind into the magnetosphere during northward IMF through the formation of a high-altitude entry layer. The observations of different sublayers with evident density and temperature differences are consistent with the view that the reconnection process at the magnetopause is not steady.},

Our dispersion relations are appropriate for deducing the relationships of the dispersive (inertial and kinetic) Alfv{\'{e}}n waves with other plasma modes. The present results can be considered as a prerequisite for understanding some salient features of the broadband electromagnetic/electrostatic waves that are frequently observed by the Freja and FAST spacecraft in the auroral zone of the Earth's ionosphere.},

abstract = {Downward propagating inertial Alfv{\'{e}}n waves (IAWs), transporting electromagnetic energy along high-latitude Earth's magnetic field lines, are a well-established phenomenon in the magnetosphere. Such waves have been detected now from Freja, FAST, and Polar satellites, showing that at the altitudes of the former two satellites, the latitudinal widths of the IAW structures are a few electron-skin depths. Since IAWs have a nonzero group velocity component Vg⊥ perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field B(r), the latitudinal fanning of the finite-width wave must impact the scaling of the wave Poynting flux S with the geocentric altitude r. We estimate the effect of the fanning on the scaling of S on B(r), showing that commonly assumed scaling S ∼ B might not be true for the narrow IAW structures. For the ultra-low-frequency (ULF) waves having frequencies in the range of a few mHz, it turns out that the width of such IAWs becomes nearly constant in altitude and S ∼ B1/2 due to the convergence of magnetic field in longitude only. Like IAWs, even the kinetic Alfven waves are expected to show a similar scaling.},

This description is carried out through examples from the National Center for Atmospheric Research thermosphereionosphere- electrodynamics general circulation model. Three ways of representing the net field-aligned currents (FAC) in the partial differential equation (PDE) are discussed: as a specified input FAC distribution, as a FAC distribution derived from a specified distribution of high-latitude electric potential, and as a representation of the FAC from the inner magnetosphere in terms of equivalent magnetospheric conductances. The chapter illustrates the calculation of geomagnetic perturbations below and above the ionosphere along with simplified calculations that reduce the 3-D current to a horizontal thin current sheet at 110 km altitude, connected to FAC above.},

We show that field-aligned currents measured by Freja in the auroral region have a spectrum of scales from ∼ 500 km down to about a hundred meters. The intensity of currents has a maximum of ∼100–300 $\mu$Am−2 at the subkilometer scales. The locations of small-scale currents (corresponding presumably to discrete auroral structures) is not coincident neither with strong macroscopic density gradients, nor with the most intense large-scale currents. These structures are observed to cluster inside medium scale density cavities and represent most likely interference patterns of short ($\lambda$⊥ ≥ c/$\omega$pe) inertial Alfv{\'{e}}n waves. At kilometer scales the energetic electrons (30 eV to 30 keV) carry less than ∼ 20{\%} of the magnetometer current, indicating that thermal electrons are the major current carriers. We discuss also vector polarization of the magnetic perturbations at various scales which may be used as a tool for resolving polarization patterns and sense of rotation for Alfv{\'{e}}n waves, vortices, and current filaments.},

@article{Strangeway2000a,
abstract = {On September 24 and 25, 1998, the Polar spacecraft observed intense outflows of terrestrial ions in association with the passage of an interplanetary shock and coronal mass ejection. The orbit of the Fast Auroral Snapshot (FAST) Explorer was in the noon-midnight meridian during this ion outflow event, and FAST passed through the day side cusp region at ∼4000 km altitude every 2.2 hours. FAST was therefore able to monitor the ion outflows subsequently observed by Polar. We show that while the outflows were more intense after the shock passage, the overall particle and field signatures within the cusp region were qualitatively similar both before and after the shock passage. FAST observations show that the cusp particle precipitation marks the lower latitude leg of a pair of field-aligned currents and further, that both field-aligned current sheets appear to be on open field lines. Moreover, the polarity of the cusp currents is controlled by the polarity of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) y-component, such that the magnetic field perturbation associated with the pair of cusp currents is in the same direction as the IMF B y . This is a consequence of the reconnection of cusp-region field lines at the magnetopause, with the flux transport resulting in electromagnetic energy being transmitted along field lines to the ionosphere as Poynting flux. We show that this Poynting flux can be as high as 120 mW m−2 (120 ergs cm−2 s−1) at FAST altitudes (∼500 mW m−2 at ionospheric altitudes), presumably because of the strong IMF B y (∼40 nT), and is the dominant energy input to the cusp-region ionosphere. Furthermore, we find that the peak ion outflow flux is correlated with the peak downward Poynting flux, although only a few passes through the cusp centered around the time of the shock passage were used to determine this correlation. The energy carried by Poynting flux is dissipated as heat within the ionosphere, through Joule dissipation. The heating will tend to increase the ionospheric scale height, allowing greater access of ionospheric ions to the altitudes where transverse ion heating via ELF waves can occur. Thus electromagnetic energy supplied by the transport of reconnected magnetic flux is the essential first step in a multistep process that enhances the outflow of ionospheric plasma in the dayside cusp.},

abstract = {The measurement of electron temperatures and metallicities in H II regions and planetary nebulae (PNe) has—for several decades—presented a problem: results obtained using different techniques disagree. What is worse, they disagree consistently. There have been numerous attempts to explain these discrepancies, but none has provided a satisfactory solution to the problem. In this paper, we explore the possibility that electrons in H II regions and PNe depart from a Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium energy distribution. We adopt a "$\kappa$-distribution" for the electron energies. Such distributions are widely found in solar system plasmas, where they can be directly measured. This simple assumption is able to explain the temperature and metallicity discrepancies in H II regions and PNe arising from the different measurement techniques. We find that the energy distribution does not need to depart dramatically from an equilibrium distribution. From an examination of data from H II regions and PNe, it appears that $\kappa$ {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {\{}gsim{\}} 10 is sufficient to encompass nearly all objects. We argue that the kappa-distribution offers an important new insight into the physics of gaseous nebulae, both in the Milky Way and elsewhere, and one that promises significantly more accurate estimates of temperature and metallicity in these regions.},

abstract = {The SS-520-2 sounding rocket skimmed over the high-latitude part of the cusp region and observed fine-scale field-aligned electron precipitations in the vicinity of the inverted-V structures with the Low Energy Particle-Electron Spectrum Analyzer (LEP-ESA). There are at least two types of fine-scale electron precipitations, namely ``edge-type electron bursts'' and ``multiple energy-time dispersions.'' Edge-type electron bursts were observed only at the edge of the inverted-V region, whereas multiple energy-time dispersions were observed separately from the inverted-V region as well as within or overlapping it. The latter was characterized by field-aligned precipitations with falling energies from {\~{}}200 eV down to {\~{}}20 eV at a repetition rate of 1-2 Hz. Source altitudes were estimated using the energy-time and pitch angle-time dispersions. As a result, we found that the source altitudes were distributed along the geomagnetic field at altitudes of several thousand kilometers, depending on the accelerated energies of electrons. Higher-energy electrons are generated at higher altitudes. The source temperature of the energy-time dispersion was much higher than that of ionospheric cold electrons. We suggest that electrons injected from the magnetosheath were accelerated by inertial Alfv{\`{e}}n waves at altitudes of several thousands of kilometers.},

abstract = {The rise time of the geomagnetic sudden commencement (SC) in low latitudes generally lies within a range from 2 to 10 min. An SC observed on 15 December 1995 was remarkable because it had an extremely long rise time of ∼30 min, although as seen by Wind, the interplanetary shock responsible for the SC was sharp as usual. The amplitude of the SC was consistent with the estimated value experimentally deduced from the increase in the solar wind dynamic pressure, implying that a complete compression of the magnetosphere occurred. However, the in situ measurement of the magnetotail by Geotail exhibited this event as an unusually gradual compression compared with a typical SC. Even this gradual compression of the magnetosphere produced a preliminary impulse on the ground that was lengthy, small, but detectable at auroral latitudes. The multisatellite observations of the interplanetary shock and the SC signals indicate that the shock normal was highly inclined duskward. Thus the orientation of the interplanetary shock or discontinuity is important in determining the SC field observed on the ground. Even if the local measurement of the solar wind dynamic pressure at a spacecraft appears to be rapid, a tilted pressure front could require many minutes to compress the forward part of the magnetosphere, producing a long rise time. Thus we can not predict the speed of the magnetospheric responses on the basis of the real-time solar wind observations without knowing the orientation of the causative shock/discontinuity. },

abstract = {We present a statistical study of the low ({\textless}1 Hz) frequency electric and magnetic field spectral densities observed by Cluster spacecraft in the high altitude cusp and mantle region. At the O+ gyrofrequency (0.02–0.5 Hz) for this region the electric field spectral density is on average 0.2–2.2 (mV m−1)2 Hz−1, implying that resonant heating at the gyrofrequency can be intense enough to explain the observed O+ energies of 20–1400 eV. The relation between the electric and magnetic field spectral densities results in a large span of phase velocities, from a few hundred km s−1 up to a few thousand km s−1. In spite of the large span of phase velocity, the ratio between the calculated local Alfv{\'{e}}n velocity and the estimated phase velocity is close to unity. We provide average values of a coefficient describing diffusion in ion velocity space at different altitudes, which can be used in studies of ion energization and outflow. The observed average waves can explain the average O+ energies measured in the high altitude (8–15 RE) cusp/mantle region of the terrestrial magnetosphere according to our test particle calculations.},

abstract = {We present self-consistent kinetic simulations of the electron response to finite duration shear Alfv{\'{e}}n wave pulses in a magnetized plasma. In Earth's magnetosphere, the evidence suggests that parallel electric fields in inertial scale shear Alfv{\'{e}}n waves can accelerate electrons in the geomagnetic field-aligned direction. Here, we study large-amplitude wave forms as they travel through ambient plasma at phase velocities which are consistent with resonant electron acceleration predicted by linear kinetic theory. Our self-consistent simulations reveal that the wave potential evolves nonlinearly as shear Alfv{\'{e}}n wave pulses travel through the simulation domain. The evolution of the wave pulse from a symmetrical to a nonsymmetrical potential structure, and the large perturbation in the distribution function required to carry the parallel current of the pulse, leads to nonresonant acceleration of electrons (i.e., acceleration of electrons which are not traveling at the same velocity as the wave). We compare the signature of resonant and nonresonant electron acceleration with data from a low-altitude spacecraft and suggest an explanation for features often referred to as field-aligned suprathermal electron bursts. Finally, we discuss how resonant and nonresonant acceleration of electrons is affected by the perpendicular wavelength and amplitude of shear Alfv{\'{e}}n wave pulses.},

abstract = {Nearly simultaneous measurements of auroral zone electric fields are obtained by the Dynamics Explorer spacecraft at altitudes below 900 km and above 4500 km during magnetic conjunctions. The measured electric fields are usually nearly perpendicular to the magnetic field lines. The north-south meridional electric fields are “projected” to a common altitude by a mapping function which accounts for the convergence of the magnetic field lines. When plotted as a function of invariant latitude, graphs of the projected electric fields measured by both DE 1 and DE 2 show that the large-scale electric field is the same at both altitudes, as expected. Superimposed on the large-scale fields, however, are small-scale features with wavelengths of less than 100 km which are larger in magnitude at the higher altitude. Fourier transforms of the electric fields show that the magnitudes depend on wavelength. Outside of the auroral zone the electric field spectrums are nearly identical. But within the auroral zone the high- and low-altitude electric fields have a ratio which increases with the reciprocal of the wavelength. The small-scale electric field variations are associated with field-aligned currents. These currents are measured with both a plasma instrument and magnetometer on DE 1. A Fourier transform of the east-west magnetic field component measured on the high-altitude satellite is found to be nearly identical to the Fourier transform of the north-south electric field measured on the low-altitude satellite, with a constant ratio. This ratio is proportional to the ionospheric conductivity. The experimental measurements are found to agree with a steady state theory which postulates that there are parallel potential drops associated with the variations in the perpendicular electric fields. It is assumed that there is a linear relationship between the field-aligned current and the total parallel potential drop and that the field-aligned currents close through Pedersen currents in the ionosphere. The theory predicts that the ratio between the low- and high- altitude electric fields varies with the wavelength. Below a “critical” wavelength the electric field is not effectively transmitted to low altitudes. Owing to the good agreement between the theory and observations, it is concluded that the linear relationship between the current density and potential drop is a valid approximation.},

abstract = {Improved techniques have been developed for empirical modeling of the high-latitude electric potentials and magnetic field-aligned currents (FAC) as a function of the solar wind parameters. The FAC model is constructed using scalar magnetic Euler potentials and functions as a twin to the electric potential model. The improved models have more accurate field values plus more accurate boundary locations. Nonlinear saturation effects in the solar wind–magnetosphere coupling are also better reproduced. The models are constructed using a hybrid technique, which has spherical harmonic functions only within a small area at the pole. At lower latitudes the potentials are constructed from multiple Fourier series functions of longitude at discrete latitudinal steps. It is shown that the magnetic (FAC) and electric potential models can be used together to calculate the total Poynting flux and Joule heating in the ionosphere. An additional model of the ionospheric conductivity is not required to obtain the ionospheric currents and Joule heating, as the conductivity variations as a function of the solar inclination are implicitly contained within the FAC model's data. The models' outputs are shown for various input conditions and are also compared with satellite measurements. The calculations of the total Joule heating are compared with results obtained by the inversion of ground-based magnetometer measurements. Like their predecessors, these empirical models should continue to be useful research and forecast tools. },

abstract = {Many observations related to the large-scale structure of the interplanetary magnetic field, its solar origin and terrestrial effects are discussed. During the period observed by spacecraft the interplanetary field was dominated by a sector structure corotating with the sun in which the field is predominantly away from the sun (on the average in the Archimedes spiral direction) for several days (as observed near the earth), and then toward the sun for several days, etc. The average sector appears to be a coherent entity with internal structure such that its preceding portion is more active than its following portion. Cosmic rays corotate with the interplanetary field, and there are differential flows associated with the sector pattern. Profound effects on geomagnetic activity and the radiation belts are produced as the sector pattern rotates past the earth. The solar origin of the sector pattern is discussed. The solar source may be associated with the large-scale weak background photospheric fields observed with the solar magnetograph. It is suggested that there may be a rather continual relation between this solar structure and terrestrial responses, of which the recurring M-Region geomagnetic storms are just the most prominent example.},

abstract = {The Center for Integrated Space Weather Modeling (CISM) is developing a simulation package of the coupled Sun–Earth system by connecting existing models within each region. The Coupled Magnetosphere Ionosphere Thermosphere (CMIT) model combines the Lyon–Fedder–Mobarry global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) magnetospheric (LFM) model with the Thermosphere Ionosphere Nested Grid (TING) model. The LFM uses the ideal MHD equations to model the interaction between the magnetospheric plasma and the solar wind. It includes the magnetosphere–ionosphere interaction by requiring the conservation of current flowing between the magnetosphere and a two dimensional ionosphere. TING is a three dimensional code designed to simulate the thermosphere–ionosphere system by solving the mass, momentum, and thermodynamic energy equations for the global thermosphere and ionosphere. Normally, TING uses parameterized models to describe the magnetospheric input into the ionosphere. We begin this paper with a description of how the TING model is used to replace the simple two dimensional ionosphere within the LFM to produce the CISM CMIT Model. The results from the coupled model for a series of steady IMF conditions are compared with the results from the LFM to show that these models have been successfully combined. The problem of high cross polar cap potentials remains, but the structure of the magnetosphere is not dramatically altered by the coupling and the ionospheric conductances show a more realistic distribution driven by EUV radiation as well as a more clearly defined auroral oval.},

abstract = {A method of inferring central plasma sheet (CPS) temperature, density, and pressure from ionospheric observations is developed. The advantage of this method over in situ measurements is that the CPS can be studied in its entirety, rather than only in fragments. As a result, for the first time, comprehensive two-dimensional equatorial maps of CPS pressure, density, and temperature within the isotropic plasma sheet are produced. These particle properties are calculated from data taken by the Special Sensor for Precipitating Particles, version 4 (SSJ4) particle instruments onboard DMSP F8, F9, F10, and F11 satellites during the entire year of 1992. Ion spectra occurring in conjunction with electron acceleration events are specifically excluded. Because of the variability of magnetotail stretching, the mapping to the plasma sheet is done using a modified Tsyganenko [1989] magnetic field model (T89) adjusted to agree with the actual magnetotail stretch at observation time. The latter is inferred with a high degree of accuracy (correlation coefficient ∼0.9) from the latitude of the DMSP b2i boundary (equivalent to the ion isotropy boundary). The results show that temperature, pressure, and density all exhibit dawn-dusk asymmetries unresolved with previous measurements. The ion temperature peaks near the midnight meridian. This peak, which has been associated with bursty bulk flow events, widens in the Y direction with increased activity. The temperature is higher at dusk than at dawn, and this asymmetry increases with decreasing distance from the Earth. In contrast, the density is higher at dawn than at dusk, and there appears to be a density enhancement in the low-latitude boundary layer regions which increases with decreasing magnetic activity. In the near-Earth regions, the pressure is higher at dusk than at dawn, but this asymmetry weakens with increasing distance from the Earth and may even reverse so that at distances X {\textless} ∼−10 to −12 RE depending on magnetic activity, the dawn sector has slightly higher pressure. The temperature and density asymmetries in the near-Earth region are consistent with the ion westward gradient/curvature drift as the ions E×B convect earthward. When the solar wind dynamic pressure increases, CPS density and pressure appear to increase, but the temperature remains relatively constant. Comparison with previously published work indicates good agreement between the inferred pressure, temperature, and density and those obtained from in situ data. This new method should provide a continuous mechanism to monitor the pressure, temperature, and density in the magnetotail with unprecedented comprehensiveness. },

abstract = {We present evidence based on measurements from the Polar spacecraft for the existence of small-scale, large-amplitude kinetic Alfv{\'{e}}n waves/spikes at the plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL) at altitudes of 4-6 RE. These structures coincide with larger-scale Alfv{\'{e}}nic waves that carry a large net Poynting flux along magnetic field lines toward the Earth. Both structures are typically observed in the PSBL but have also been observed deeper in the plasma sheet. The small-scale spikes have electric field amplitudes up to 300 mV m-1 and associated magnetic field variations between 0.5 and 5 nT. Previous analysis has shown that the larger-scale Alfv{\'{e}}n waves have periods of ∼20-60 s and carry enough Poynting flux to explain the generation of the most intense auroral structures observed in the Polar Ultraviolet Imager data set. In this paper it is shown that the smaller-scale waves have durations in the spacecraft frame of 250 ms to 1 s (but may have shorter time durations since the Nyquist frequency of the magnetic field experiment is ∼4 Hz.). The characteristic ratio of the amplitudes of the electric to magnetic field fluctuations is strong evidence that the waves are kinetic Alfv{\'{e}}n waves with scale sizes perpendicular to the magnetic field on the order of 20-120 km (with an electron inertial length cl$\omega$pe∼10 km and an ion gyroradius ∼20 km). Theoretical analysis of the observed spikes suggests that these waves should be very efficient at accelerating electrons parallel to the magnetic field. Simultaneously measured electron velocity space distribution functions from the Polar Hydra instrument include parallel electron heating features and earthward electron beams, indicating strong parallel energization. The characteristic parallel energy is on the order of ∼1 keV, consistent with estimates of the parallel ∫ Edl associated with small-scale kinetic Alfv{\'{e}}n wave structures. The energy flux in the electron "beams" is ∼0.7 ergs cm-2 s-1. These observations suggest that the small-scale kinetic Alfv{\'{e}}n waves are generated from the larger-scale Alfv{\'{e}}n waves through one or more of a variety of mechanisms that have been proposed to result in the filamentation of large-amplitude Alfv{\'{e}}n waves. The observations presented herein provide strong evidence that in addition to the auroral particle energization processes known to occur at altitudes between 0.5 and 2 RE, there are important heating and acceleration mechanisms operating at these higher altitudes in the plasma sheet.

The distortion of the magnetopause, the periodic features of vortex flows, the tailward propagation, and the evaluation of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) condition support the evidence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices produced by the velocity shear at the duskside of magnetopause.

abstract = {The suggestion that the polar cap can completely disappear under certain northward IMF conditions is still controversial. We know that the size of the polar cap is strongly controlled by the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Under a southward IMF, the polar cap is usually large and filled with weak diffuse polar rain electrons. The polar cap shrinks under a northward IMF. Here we use the global auroral images and coincident particle measurements on May 15, 2005 to show that the discrete arcs (due to precipitation of both electrons and ions) expanded from the dayside oval to the nightside oval and filled the whole polar ionosphere after a long (8h) and strong (∼5–30nT) northward IMF Bz, The observations suggested that the polar cap disappeared under a closed magnetosphere.},

abstract = {The POLAR mission is ideally suited to study the high-altitude polar cusp. Polar magnetometer data, together with electron and ion measurements from the Hydra and Toroidal Imaging Mass-Angle Spectrograph (Timas) instruments from March 1996 to December 1997, have been used to identify 459 polar cusp crossings. These crossings are used to study the statistical behavior of the cusp location and its dependence on the solar wind conditions. We find that the invariant latitude of the center of the cusp varies from 70° to 86° as solar wind conditions change and the magnetic local time of the footprints of the cusp magnetic field lines extends from 0800 to 1600 MLT, the cusp being slightly wider for increasing solar wind dynamic pressure. The average latitude of the center of the cusp is at 80.3° invariant latitude at noon and decreases to 78.7° at 0800 and 1600 MLT. The cusp also appears to thicken slightly in invariant latitude with increasing dynamic pressure. The center of the cusp moves equatorward with increasingly southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) to 73° invariant latitude for a 10 nT southward IMF. The cusp moves only slightly for northward IMF. This motion is consistent with erosion of dayside magnetic flux for southward IMF but little or no erosion for northward IMF. The cusp is also somewhat wider in invariant latitude with increasingly northward IMF. Consistent with low-altitude observations, we find that there is a clear MLT shift due to the IMF By for strongly southward IMF. We interpret the motion of the local time of the cusp for southward IMF as a shift of the reconnection site away from the noon meridian when the IMF is not due southward.},

abstract = {Auroral studies have shown that there are systematic displacements and significant intensity differences of the aurora in the two hemispheres. Such observations have been systematically correlated with the various components of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and hemispherical differences in solar exposure. This chapter reviews some new results on nonconjugate phenomena that have been reported the last couple of years. It focuses on the three suggested mechanisms to produce asymmetric aurora in the conjugate hemispheres. The mechanisms discussed in the chapter are: difference in region 1 currents due to hemispheric differences in the solar wind dynamo efficiency when the IMF has a significant Bx component; interhemispheric or asymmetric currents associated with the “penetration” of the IMF By component into the closed magnetosphere; and interhemispheric currents due to conductivity differences in the two hemispheres.},

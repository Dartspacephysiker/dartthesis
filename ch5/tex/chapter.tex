\chapter{Application of a new method for calculation of low-frequency
  wave vectors}
\label{chp:5}

This chapter is the version of the manuscript ``Application of a new
method for calculation of low-frequency wave vectors'' that has been
submitted for publication in \textsl{Proceedings of the 8th
  International Workshop on Planetary, Solar and Heliospheric Radio
  Emissions}, and is awaiting peer review.

The contributions of each author are as follows:

\textbf{S.M. Hatch} conceived of possible application to FAST \Alf
wave observations after discussing the article with M. Broughton, and
suggested to J. LaBelle the project would make a nice presentation at
PRE~VIII. He originally drafted all portions of the manuscript, which
were then heavily reviewed by J. LaBelle.

\textbf{J. LaBelle} helped with suitable event selection, wrote
substantial portions of the introduction and parts of the discussion,
and produced the top right panels in Figure~2 and Figure~4. He was
heavily involved in most aspects of study execution and all aspects of
manuscript production (in some cases adding tangible mass to the
manuscript in the form of red ink).

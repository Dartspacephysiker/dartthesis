Thesis Template for Dartmouth College
=====================================
Dartthesis is a LaTeX template for a thesis manuscript intended to be submitted at
Dartmouth College. However, the template is general enough that it may be used as a 
basic template at other institutions. The template is based on my PhD thesis, submitted 
and accepted in 2013. Style and formatting there conform to guidelines layed out in 
2013 by the Dartmouth College Graduate Studies Office.

*Always* remember to check that formatting guidelines for this year (if at Dartmouth) or
for your own institution. Updated descriptions are available from the 
[Grad Studies webpage](http://graduate.dartmouth.edu/).
